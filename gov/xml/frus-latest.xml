        <summary>As part of the Foreign Relations subseries devoted to the foreign policy of the administration of President Jimmy Carter, this volume is the second of two volumes that document U.S. efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli dispute. This volume begins with the August 1978 acceptance by Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin of President Carter’s invitation to attend a tripartite summit meeting at Camp David. It traces the course of the September 1978 Camp David Summit and the series of negotiations which followed, talks which culminated in the conclusion of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty on March 26, 1979.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. The volume has been divided into two parts: Part One, published in 2012, documents the intellectual foundations of the foreign policy of the second Nixon and Ford administrations and should be read in conjunction with this release; Part Two, this specific volume, covers the organization and management of the foreign policy process as well as the development of U.S. information policy, public diplomacy, and cultural affairs during the 1973–1976 period. The volume documents not only the ways in which the end of the Vietnam War, the scandal over Watergate, the emergence of greater congressional assertiveness in foreign affairs, and the August 1974 resignation of President Nixon all affected the organization of U.S. foreign policymaking institutions, but also the impact of broader changes within U.S. society, most notably the changing roles of women and minorities, and the proliferation of transnational, global issues as agents of organizational change. On the volume’s coverage of public diplomacy, the Stanton Panel Report of 1975 figures prominently, as it examined the range of activity in this function—including Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, USIA, and the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs—and the issues of governance in such a complex multi-agency endeavor. The structure and activity of the Intelligence Community formed another major organizational focus for policymakers in this period, and is also covered in this volume. Most notably, the volume documents the Ford administration’s response to the controversial December 1974 “Family Jewels” revelations about Intelligence Community activities and the series of congressional investigations they prompted, as well as the institutional reforms which the administration implemented in 1976.

        <summary>This is the first chapter in a retrospective volume which will augment the Foreign Relations of the United States series’ coverage of U.S. public diplomacy. While the series began to document the subject in a sustained and concerted way starting with the second administration of President Richard M. Nixon, previous FRUS coverage of U.S. public diplomacy efforts have been far less consistent. This retrospective volume will fill that gap, which stretches from the First World War to the early 1970s. This compilation covers World War I; subsequent compilations, which will document up to the end of the first Nixon administration, will be published as they are completed. The compilation also features the first inclusion of film in a Foreign Relations of the United States volume. (Published 2014-11-25. Editor: Aaron W. Marrs. General Editor: Adam M. Howard.)</summary>

        <summary>This volume documents the intellectual foundations of the Jimmy Carter administration’s foreign policy. Unlike other volumes in the Carter subseries, the documentation seeks to illustrate the collective mindset of Carter administration officials on foreign policy issues in the broadest sense. Rather than the formulation of individual foreign policy decisions or diplomatic exchanges, the compilation takes as its canvas the entire record of the Carter administration. The volume also covers the immediate pre-presidential period, from Jimmy Carter’s December 1974 announcement that he would campaign for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination to the transition between the Gerald Ford and Carter administrations.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The focus of this volume is on the relationship between the United States and North Africa during the Nixon and Ford administrations from 1973 until 1976. The Maghreb presented opportunities and challenges for both the Nixon and Ford administrations as they sought to broker settlements to conflicts in the Middle East and to limit Soviet exploitation of tensions in the region. Stability in the Maghreb was considered vital to achieving these goals, but proved increasingly difficult to attain due to Libya’s actions in the region and the destabilizing impact of Spain’s withdrawal from the Spanish Sahara.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The focus of this volume is on the relationship between the United States and Western Europe during the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations from 1973 until 1976. It begins by examining the relationship from a regional perspective, focusing on the Year of Europe initiative, U.S. relations with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and with the European Communities, and issues such as the rise of Eurocommunism. The volume then explores U.S. bilateral relations with nine countries: Canada, Portugal, Iceland and Norway (paired in a single Nordic countries chapter), Spain, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and Italy, which will be added when it is cleared for publication.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration. The focus of this volume is on U.S. policy towards the Eastern Mediterranean region. The Carter administration’s major goals during this period were to broker a peace deal to unify Cyprus, which was divided since the Turkish invasion of 1974; to lift the arms embargo enacted by Congress on Turkey as a result of the invasion; and to reintegrate Greece into the NATO military alliance, from which Athens had withdrawn in protest of Turkey’s actions in Cyprus. President Carter was keenly interested in securing a negotiated settlement between the divided Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, and he made it a high-level priority at the outset of his term. Despite intensive efforts headed by the Department of State and Carter’s emissary Clark Clifford, an agreement to unify Cyprus eluded the Carter administration; today the island remains divided. The Carter administration was more successful in its campaign on Capitol Hill to lift the arms embargo on Turkey, thereby alleviating a significant source of tension between Washington and Ankara, while at the same time convincing the Greek leadership to re-join NATO’s military command structure. Although the Carter administration was unable to resolve the Cyprus dispute, it secured a significant diplomatic and strategic victory by ensuring that NATO’s southern tier was much stronger by the time President Carter left office.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford presidential administrations. The focus of this volume is on the formulation and implementation of U.S. national security policy primarily vis-à-vis the Soviet Union and, to a lesser extent, the People's Republic of China during Nixon's abbreviated second term in office and Ford's subsequent administration. It also documents intelligence and its role in the policy process, as well as the Ford administration's efforts to bolster U.S. telecommunications security. Finally, the volume presents documents on the Hughes Glomar Explorer, the centerpiece of a secret mission organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to raise a Soviet submarine sunk in the Pacific Ocean.

        <summary>This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, this volume also includes documentation on U.S. foreign policy toward Congo-Léopoldville during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. It is therefore a retrospective, composite volume, which covers U.S. policy in Congo-Léopoldville from March 1960 through December 1968. It should be read as a supplement to Foreign Relations, 1958–1960, Volume XIV, Africa, and Foreign Relations, 1961–1963, Volume XX, Congo Crisis. (Published 2013-12-16. Editors: Nina D.
