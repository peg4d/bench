<Partnership_x0020_Name>Afghan Folad Steel Mill</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This GDA will support the Afghan Folad Steel Mill Company (AFSMC), which is currently the only regional producer of steel reinforcement bars (rebars) used in reinforced concrete construction; to expand their operations to recycle scrap steel into the raw product for the production of a range of construction inputs.  The GDA will allow the company to source raw materials domestically, redressing their existing sourcing difficulties, whilst creating the first domestic buyer in the scrap metal value-chain.   Currently, all afghan scrap metal and depreciated steel is illegally exported on an ad hoc basis, which lowers the price for afghan dealers whilst preventing the development of a large and regular network of dealers to develop. In addition, the lack of regular domestic supplies of inputs, means that all producers of steel construction inputs are required to import raw products, at a higher cost (due to transport costs and the 14 % import &amp; BRT tax), whilst dealing with long delays due to inefficient and politically sensitive customs regimes. The end result of these problems is regular supply shortages, compounded with extremely high prices for inputs. The knock-on effect to the development of other steel construction input producers is significant, as it is almost as cost effective and easy for construction companies (and large funders such as ISAF) to import finished products from Pakistan/CIS countries, as it is to produce the products in the region.    By facilitating the only regional producer of steel construction inputs to develop a domestic production of their inputs, this GDA aims to redress the high cost of these inputs, whilst vastly increasing their availability in the local market. In redressing this bottleneck in the value-chain (i.e. lowering cost and ensuring a regular supply of inputs), the GDA will increase the profitability of the growing number of construction companies in the country. In addition, the GDA will also provide the missing component for a large scale formal network of scrap metal dealers to develop in the country.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Africa Cashew Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The demand for cashew kernels worldwide has increased by over 5% over the last 10 years and projected to continue to grow. The USG, through the African Cashew Alliance (ACA) has identified the need to grow the cashew industry in West Africa to help the region take advantage of the increasing demand for cashews. In FY 2013, World class companies like Intersnack, Kraft Foods, Red River Foods and Olam partnered with the ACA and USAID through a Global Development Alliance (GDA) to develop the ACA quality seal program. The ACA Seal program aims to increase demand for cashews processed in Africa, on the international market, and will contribute toward raising incomes and reducing poverty in cashew-producing countries of West Africa. Currently West Africa alone produces over 30% of the world’s raw cashew nut crop. The problem for West Africa is that most of the cashew is exported in the raw form and provides relatively low incomes and employment for the region. Through this GDA with the ACA, the USG will support the West African cashew sector by facilitating investments in value-added processing in Africa. The ACA seal requires processors to comply with international food safety, quality, and labor standards. Adoption and recognition of the ACA quality seal provides processors the opportunity to grow the demand for cashews processed in Africa on the international market, and will contribute toward raising incomes and reducing poverty in cashew-producing countries of West Africa primarily Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Cote D’Ivoire.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>African Alliance for Improved Food Processing - Regional</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>&quot;The African Alliance for Improved Food Processing (2010-2012), a USAID/PEPFAR partnership with General Mills and other private-sector firms, linked the technical and business expertise of large food companies with small and medium-sized mills and food processors in 15 countries, enhancing those companies’ ability to produce high-quality, nutritious food at affordable prices. The core expertise of food scientists, process engineers, and operations managers improved beneficiary firms’ operational efficiency and expanded their potential markets and product offerings. By improving the manufacturing and business practices of these local firms, AAIFP also strengthened local markets. The partnership’s long-term vision was to engage multiple food companies and industry associations to extend similar skills to processors in the rest of Africa. Implemented by TechnoServe, the alliance was valued at $21 million and benefited the 1.6 million smallholder farmers supplying these businesses. Over three years, the consortium of companies contributed up to 218,000 labor hours, worth up to $17 million. General Mills’ total contribution reached $5.4 million, comprised of cash and 65,000 labor hours. The U.S. Government’s commitment (PEPFAR/USAID) was initially expected to be $1.8 million, potentially ramping up to $4 million as more companies join the consortium. By the end of 2012, the alliance hopes to have helped up to 35 processors meet national food standards, in turn helping to increase the affordability of nutritious food available to African consumers.

<Description>The goal of the AAIFP Ethiopia Project is to provide technical assistance to medium and large commercial wheat millers, producers of fortified blended foods and flours, bakeries, and pasta manufacturers to improve business efficiencies and processing capacity of fortified blended foods and flours for commercial markets and targeted food aid populations. Local food processors and sector entities are being supported to improve business practices and meet food safety and quality standards. Engagement with food processors will result in expanded market access for smallholder farmers, producer organizations, traders, and other businesses. The PPP supports the Feed the Future Initiative as it supports the wheat value chain by strengthening agribusinesses such as wheat millers. The PPP also directly supports the Global Health Initiative by increasing the availability of nutritious foods such as Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods and other products targeted to vulnerable populations including peoples living with HIV/AIDS. AAIFP will also support the GOE’s Agricultural Growth Program, National Nutrition Program, and National Food Fortification Program.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>African Diaspora Marketplace I &amp; II</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The African Diaspora Marketplace (2009-2014), a USAID partnership with Western Union and Ecobank, encouraged sustainable economic growth and local employment by supporting U.S.-based African diaspora entrepreneurs with innovative ideas for businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through the alliance, Western Union and the Western Union Foundation provide its consumer base (mobile workers) with the tools and resources to launch successful businesses, creating jobs and opportunities in the entrepreneurs’ home countries. The 2009-2010 business plan competition awarded fourteen $100,000 matching grants to winning entries hailing from seven different countries. Highlights of the grantees’ successes include launching the first mobile anti-counterfeiting service for pharmaceutical drugs in Nigeria, the first GPS tracking system to prevent product loss in Ethiopia, and a high-speed ferry system powered by locally-produced sunflower oil in East Africa, which cut travel time across Lake Victoria by 40% while enlisting 600 indigenous farmers to grow sunflower seeds to produce the vegetable oil powering the ferries. Another success is the launch of Cooking Solar Ovens, starting with 1,000 stoves in Uganda but with a goal of 10,000, saving an estimated 1.5 tons of wood a year per family and cutting indoor air pollution by 70%, thus improving the users’ health. The 2011-2012 competition awarded grants to seventeen winning entries from seven different countries, with variable matching grant sizes up to $50,000 in cash and $20,000 in technical assistance. This ADM competition specifically focused grants on high-impact sectors, including agribusiness, renewable energy, and ICT. Partner investment over the life of the project is $1.5 million.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Agriculture Technology Program for Turkmenistan</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Through this project, USAID supports the profitability of private farmers working in two important sectors of the agricultural economy of Turkmenistan.  Activities include: 1) Improving the productivity of livestock, both dairy cattle and meat-producing stock.  This is accomplished through upgrading the genetic material of animals and technical assistance and training programs for livestock producers.  Specialized training is provided to veterinary experts as a means of improving animal health through modern feeding programs and disease protection. 2)  Assisting growers, processors, and marketing specialists of high-value horticultural crops, especially in selected fruits and vegetables. Building the skills of greenhouse owners is a program priority.  After conducting an analysis of selected crops, USAID will promote capacity building of all the players along the value chain of those commodities that have the greatest potential for both domestic and international markets. This is a country-specific project.</Description>

<Description>Objectives:  1. Improve sustainable management of coastal economic resources in El Salvador.  2. Improve incomes of coastal community residents in El Salvador.  3. Improve environmental awareness among coastal community residents in El Salvador.  4. Improve sea turtle conservation in El Salvador. Coastal marine resources make an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy and are an important source of income for coastal residents. Background and Results: Because these resources are not well or sustainably managed, their contributions to the Salvadoran economy are at risk with impacts that fall heavily on the economically vulnerable coastal communities.     Since 2006, USAID/IMCCW has worked to improve Salvadoran natural resource management. In FY 2010 sea turtle conservation is one focus drawing attention to the broader need to improve coastal natural resource management and establish sustainable levels and methods of economic exploitation.    The state of sea turtles reflects the general state of Salvadoran coastal resources. Habitat degradation and unregulated, unsustainable collecting of the eggs of the four species of sea turtles nesting in El Salvador have brought a once abundant resource close to extinction with consequences that have affected thousands of families.    In February 2009 the Government of El Salvador banned any form of sea turtle commercialization. The economic impact would have fallen mostly on vulnerable tortugueros and their families. USAID/IMCCW and other organizations established a program that paid tortugueros to bring sea turtle eggs to beach hatcheries for protected incubation and release. This program succeeded in replacing lost tortugueros income, and released over 1 million sea turtle hatchlings. The program continues in 2011 as part of a long-term, national program of sea turtle conservation.    The AGRISAL ACTISA Partnership will establish an alliance to support sea turtle hatchery operations in the Salamar beach in El Salvador. The partnership will use seed funding from USAID/IMCCW to bring together the AGRISAL ACTISA and the Salamar tortuguero group to continue sea turtle egg collection activities and hatchery operations for at least five years.    According to the AOR, this partnership has ended.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Alliance with The Andes Association (ALAC) To Improve Governance and Reduce Social Conflict</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>In the department of Cajamarca, mining companies have brought jobs and contributed much-needed resources to municipal and regional coffers.  But revenue alone has not solved the problems that public administrators face, problems which hinder growth and can obstruct progress to improve citizens’ lives.  Social conflict poses additional challenges for these subnational governments as poverty remains high despite vast amounts of extractive resources pouring into communities.  In response, USAID/Peru and the Asociación Los Andes de Cajamarca (ALAC), the corporate social responsibility foundation of Yanacocha (one of Peru’s largest mining companies) are pioneering an effort to create stronger and more responsive sub-national governments and to give citizens a voice in government.  Gold Fields Mining Company recently agreed to enter the alliance, although specifics on their contribution are under negotiation.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Aman Tirta - Safe Water for Indonesia</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Aman Tirta program is a USAID-funded effort to improve access to safe water through point-of-use water treatment. Instead of making a subsidized product that would be available and distributed for the short duration of a project, Aman Tirta has taken a new approach by facilitating the production and distribution of a product that will be commercially viable in the Indonesian market, ensuring its sustainability after the program funding has ended.     There are five main parties supporting Air RahMat. The Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health&apos;s Center for Communication Programs is responsible for overall program strategy design, management, and communication and behavior change interventions. CARE is leading the community participation component and enhancing water treatment socialization and adoption and the implementation of the program. PT Tanshia Consumer Products is manufacturing, bottling, and packaging the Air RahMat product. PT Dos ni Roha, one of Indonesia&apos;s leading distributors of pharmaceutical, health, and personal care products, is distributing Air RahMat across a full range of outlets from various stores to clinics and kiosks. LOWE Worldwide is handling the developing and implementation of the marketing and positioning of Air RahMat. The financial support in its nascent period allows these companies to form relationships and &quot;work out the kinks&quot; while it has a safety net. Additionally, the Aman Tirta project is working to build the capacity of PT Tanshia (who will take over whole responsibility for Air RahMat in 2009). In this vein, the project works with PT Tanshia on brand management; outreach to NGOs; advocacy with the government; community mobilization; and building a business network so that they will be able to continue the success of Air RahMat as a commercial product.     When a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit Yogyakarta, Aman Tirta distributed more than 100,000 bottles of Air RahMat through UNICEF, CARE, and other relief organizations. Following the flooding in Aceh in December 2006, UNICEF distributed Air RahMat to ensure a ready supply of safe drinking water.    The Aman Tirta program debuted Air RahMat to the Indonesian market in Jakarta in December 2005. In addition to facilitating the commercialization of the Air RahMat product, the Aman Tirta program supports its use through education about safe water and health.</Description>

<Description>The AMARTA Sulawesi Kakao Alliance (2006-2011), a USAID partnership with Blommer Chocolate Company and OLAM International, worked to improve agribusiness productivity and quality, and provided better market access for thousands of Indonesian farmers and villages, specifically in the coffee, cocoa and high-value horticulture industries. By providing training in pest and disease control technologies and cocoa best management practices, the alliance improved farm productivity and increased the incomes of rural cocoa farmers. Additionally, partners provided local farmers with information on the cocoa grading process, enabling them to reap greater profits. During the five-year program, more than 190,000 farmers and 2,000 extension workers and business people received training and support services; almost 4,000 producer organizations, business associations, and community-based organizations received assistance; agricultural technical advisors introduced a large number of new technologies and management practices; and smallholders producing coffee, cocoa, and high-value fruits, vegetables, and flowers earned more than $370 million – an 88% increase in earnings. Olam International set up 9 rural buying stations in South and Southeast Sulawesi. Total project investment reached $21 million. The success of the project led to the establishment of $20 million AMARTA II, the implementation of which is ongoing (2011-2016).</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Amazon Cacao Development Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The alliance aims to guarantee the long-term profitability of sustainable cacao production, and in doing so, increase the income, improve the standard of living of 3,200 families, and ensure a stable, democratic future for the region.  The Alliance will concretely increase Yachana Gourmet S.A. chocolate production capacity by at least four fold during the project&apos;s life, reaching a sales level of at least one metric ton of processed chocolate per month.  This increase will translate into purchases of dried cacao beans: 20 metric tons the 1st year, and 40 mt the 2nd.  The produce not purchased by Yachana for processing will be channeled by the Alliance towards terminal markets, leaving more margin to producers.  During FY 2004, the Amazon Cocoa Development Alliance expanded the chocolate production capacity from one to two metric tons per month, resulting in an increase of annual sales from $44,000 to $170,000.  This increase in sales included an increase of 52 to 65 tons in production of cocoa from 1,200 beneficiary families.  These families also benefited from other USAID-funded projects to improve fermentation and drying of the cocoa beans.  Since not all these beans were purchased by Yachana S.A., farmers were assisted in selling the remaining harvest directly to other exporters, which resulted in increased sales per family and income increases of about 51% and 28% for Napo and Sucumbios provinces’ farmers, respectively.</Description>

<Description>The Angola Electricity Support Program is improving electricity service delivery to communities in peri-urban  Luanda.  The Program is working to update the planning tools for local administrations and the power utility, while also empowering citizens through collective engagement in public planning. Rebuilding the electricity network for residential, commercial and industrial use is critical to restoring normal life in Angola. In this program, the community&apos;s views and needs are taken into account in the design of the electricity network. Through different community participation mechanisms, community groups have a chance to enter into open dialogue both with EDEL, the electricity distribution company, and the local government for greater accountability, transparency and responsiveness. The technical components of the program test strategies for electricity connection, metering, billing and collection.
The program&apos;s focus areas are in the peri-urban municipalities of Kilamba Kiaxi and Viana. The Angola Electricity Support Program is expected to serve as a model for other locations in Angola.</Description>

<Description>The Angolan Development Alliance (2002-2012), a USAID partnership with Chevron implemented by Africare, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Save the Children, and World Vision, worked to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable households, help farmers more effectively produce and market high-value crops, build the municipal government’s institutional capacity, and develop, implement, and monitor local communities’ programs promoting sustainable development and better governance structures for local decision-making. The alliance helped return 300,000 people to productive lives and restore the country’s agriculture and economy, contributing to a 45% improvement in food security among the most vulnerable population. The alliance also established Novo Banco, a provider of micro-credit to entrepreneurs and low-income households. By 2005, Novo Banco had disbursed more than $3 million in loans (averaging $5,000) to more than 800 borrowers, half of them women, with a 98% repayment rate. Total project investment reached $33 million, with USAID putting in $16.8 million, and Chevron $16.2 million.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Aswan Governorate Microfinance Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The alliance among USAID, First Microfinance Foundation, Egypt and Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance seeks to advance USAID/Egypt’s strategic objectives in economic development, specifically related to the introduction of modern and efficient financial services, support for enterprise formation and increased employment and competition opportunities for Egyptians in rural and urban parts of the Aswan Governorate in Upper Egypt.  Through the provision of microcredit services, the AGMP aims to improve the quality of life of low-income households in the governorate.  Planned activities will: support the expansion and sustainability of the locally-managed Microfinance Institution (MFI), the FMF to new and remote areas in Aswan Governorate; develop relevant products delivered to individuals and to groups within the target population that improve livelihoods of the intended beneficiaries by increasing their financial, physical, social and human assets; broaden the geographic coverage of the AGMP to nine branches and sub-branches distributed among the urban and rural areas in Aswan Governorate, with potential expansion to other Upper Egypt Governorates; put in place substantial efforts to serve as many women as possible, by having female clients at least 65 percent of the outstanding loan portfolio; retain a rural and poverty alleviation focus on serving small holders and low-income entrepreneurs by aiming to have loans of less than ($404) as at least 50 percent of the outstanding loan portfolio by the end of the project period; and achieve the outreach targets set out in Table 1 under Planned Results below.  USAID/Egypt will contribute $3,300,000 through a cooperative agreement.  The contribution will be matched by an investment of $2,550,000 from AKAM and an investment of $750,000 from FMF into AGMP over the cooperative agreement period.  The cost share will therefore be divided equally between USAID on the one hand and AKAM and FMF on the other, through the Global Development Alliance (GDA).</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>AWAZ Communication Improvement</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Awaz Communications will produce a weekly Business &amp; Economical newsmagazine called “Afghan Successes” and broadcast though both television and radio. By showing people’s successful enterprises and projects while visually demonstrating the true business opportunities that Afghanistan can offer, the global aim of the program will be to encourage private initiatives and investments.  Primarily targeting the Afghan business community, the program will combine information (interviews, features…) and more entertaining formats (reportages, portraits, business tips…), in order to attract much wider audiences (young entrepreneurs, farmers, and women). In that regard, it is important to mention that an important component of the program will be every week dedicated to Afghan business women.  Recorded in Dari and Pashto, the program content will mix topics and formats in both languages, using simple and accessible words &amp; concepts in order to reach the targeted audiences.  Animated by a presenter/moderator, the show will include guests and participants from the private sector, leading political figures, and key members from the business community to comment and analyse the various developments.   The program will be broadcasted at prime time (6-8 pm) once a week. It will last around 30 min with 2 commercial breaks.    Content:  Synopsis of the program:  Hot news: 1. Jingle + introduction       (01 min) 2. Economic regional (Central Asia) news bulletin   (03 mins) 3. Local Market fluctuations &amp; price list     (02 mins)  Cold news: 1. Animator studio      (01 min) 2. Success story report       (07 mins) 3. Animator studio      (01 min) 4. People’s Q&amp;A (Institutional support + facilities)  (04 mins) 5. Agro-business development report     (06 mins) 6. Animator studio      (01 min) 7. Women’s basic business course     (03 mins) 8. Conclusion + jingle       (01 min) After almost eight years of continuous economical growth and due to the ongoing political turmoil, the global investment in the country’s economy has sharply and worryingly dropped last year from almost 50%.   If this sudden apprehension of the Afghan markets can easily be understood, it should certainly not hide the fact that deep foundations have been laid by the Afghan Government and the international community to favor the development of a sustainable and prosperous economy.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Ayobi Poultry</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This GDA will support one of the largest poultry farm and processing facilities in Western Afghanistan to produce and supply poultry farming inputs (chicks and feed), to the regional market. Through the supply of equipment and training, the GDA will provide new technologies (improved breed mother stocks, industrial incubators, a feed-mill combined with a blood and offal processor), which will enable the company to supply inputs of a higher quality, and lower price, than the imported inputs presently available.  Currently, the only poultry farming inputs available on the Herat market are imports, which constantly vary in quality and specification; for example, inputs imported from Iran tend to be rejects from the Iranian domestic market and are therefore, often of extremely poor quality (chicks of mixed varieties of breed, differing levels of vitamin/protein enhancement in feed, etc). This results in a constant variation in the type/quality of the afghan producers end products (slaughtered chickens/eggs), consequently preventing these producers from investing in standardized packaging and branding. Furthermore, the transportation of vulnerable inputs (one-day old chicks) in the severe weather conditions of the western region, leads to a very high rate of product loss/damage during the transportation. As a result, only large-scale actors can afford to take the risk in importing the significant volumes of inputs which make the operation profitable. The end result of these supply problems is regular supply shortages, compounded with extremely high prices for inputs. The knock-on effect to the development of poultry farming in the region is significantly detrimental, as it is relatively easy and almost as cost effective to import finished products (frozen chickens &amp; eggs) from Pakistan/Iran, as it is to produce the products in the region.   By facilitating the main regional importer of inputs to develop a domestic production of inputs, this GDA aims to redress the high cost of these inputs, whilst vastly increasing their availability and quality in the local market.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Baley Sustainable Development Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This public-private partnership is piloting a multi-sector model of community development for municipalities dependent on the mining industry.  Its funding partners are the Barrick Gold Corporation and Highland Gold Mining, Ltd.  The implementing partners include:  the Center for Fiscal Policy (CFP); New Eurasia Foundation (NEF); Russian Microfinance Center (RMC); and the Siberian Civic Initiatives Support  Center (SCISC).  This project is implementing a multi-sector model of community development in the city of Baley, which is located in the Chita Oblast in southern Siberia.  The project includes activities to develop small and medium-sized enterprises, improve education and services, and strengthen the city administration.  The goals of the partnership are to: create jobs by strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises; improve the quality and quantity of goods and services available locally; improve the quality of education and workforce development; improve the capacity of the municipal administration to fulfill basic local government functions and services; and mobilize citizens and local resources to address social problems in the community.  The Barrick Gold Corporation plans to replicate this model of corporate social responsibility and small business support in other regions of Russia where the company operates.  Each of the implementing partners contributed to the project.  The Siberian Civic Initiatives Support Center (SCISC) introduced a system of competitive social grants to fund local initiatives and organized social fairs to present the results.  These social grants helped fund one school’s purchase of a car to teach students and help them obtain driver’s licenses, as well as another school’s program of specialized student field trips to explore local geological and tourist sights.  The following year, this study model was adopted by six more schools in the city.  SCISC also introduced the “socially active school” model to involve teachers, administrators, students and their parents in social projects.  As a result, one school found business sponsors to finance a renovation of the school and save it from closure.  Three other schools developed their capacity to successfully apply for funding from the national innovative education development program.  The Russian Microfinance Center (RMC) and New Eurasia Foundation (NEF) created a credit cooperative in Baley that provides additional business and income opportunities to its members and their families.  The Center for Fiscal Policy (CFP) conducted two seminars on inter-governmental fiscal relations and expansion of the municipal tax base.  CFP also developed recommendations to increase the efficiency of municipal enterprises.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Bamtaare Fouta-Toro Project</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Bamtaare Fouta-Toro Project is a $25.8 million partnership between USAID Food for Peace, Counterpart International and Medicines for Humanity in northern Senegal.  The partnership strives to strengthen human capabilities in health, education, and nutrition by improving educational opportunities, caretaker practices in health, nutrition, and hygiene and increasing nutritional and organization support to people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children. The partnership between USAID Food for Peace and Counterpart International provides technical assistance, training and pharmaceuticals to implement the five-year Title II Bamtaare Fouta-Toro Project.  The project strengthens the health, education, and nutrition sectors by improving educational opportunities, caretaker practices in health, nutrition, and hygiene and increasing nutritional and organization support to people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children.   The $25.8 million project concentrates its activities in the northern region of Senegal including the St.Louis and Matam regions.   Through Title II funding USAID provides $15.1 million to the partnership. As part of their contribution, Counterpart International provides $10.7 million average wholesale value of pharmaceuticals to implement the project.  Medications are provided to Counterpart (CPI) through an outside private donor, Medicines for Humanity. Types of pharmaceuticals provided include deworming medicines, vitamin A, and multivitamins.  The donor also provides CPI with vitamin A (only 66 % of children under five currently receive supplementation) to children age 6-59 months and iron supplements to all pregnant and lactating women during the growth monitoring and promotion sessions.  The partnership focuses on some of the main causes of disease and malnutrition in Senegal. Intestinal parasites impair optimal food utilization, affecting women and children disproportionately. To prevent parasitic infections, every six months, children under five and adults are de-wormed at community weighing days.  It has been proven that as much as 25% of nutrients in children can be absorbed by parasites without proper treatment.  Community Health Workers (CHWs), trained by the project, administer high-dose Vitamin A under the supervision of the Ministry of Health every six months, following Government of Senegal protocol.  Iron supplements are distributed monthly.  The project plans to phase out this micronutrient supplementation once the household gardens component of the program starts providing populations a diet richer in carotenoids and iron.  The direct benefits of this project are healthier children who are free of parasites, better nourished, and have stronger immune systems.   Women who receive micronutrient supplementation also benefit from improved health and nutrition status and fewer complications during pregnancy and childbirth.</Description>

<Description>Objective: To increase sustainable, market-led, growth across the entire food production and value chain, resulting in improved food and income security for 40,000 households in selected areas in Eastern Province. USAID’s partnership with Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO), General Mills, Cargill, and the Ministry of Agriculture has increased farmers economic and food security through access to fertility boosting conservation methods and markets for their production.  The partnership has allowed COMACO, with financial support from USAID and technical support from General Mills, to upgrade its food processing facilities to reduce wastage by 50 percent and increase production by 300 percent with a five-fold reduction in customer complaints in the past year.  This improved processing makes COMACO’s product offering more competitive as well as permitting it to train and buy from more small-scale farmers in environmentally vulnerable areas.  In addition, Cargill has offered a market for farmers’ surplus soy production.  As a result, these small-scale farmers are able to sustainably increase their production and income and rely less on animal poaching, charcoal production, and other environmentally harmful practices.  Thus far over 20,000 new farmers have been recruited and trained in the past year with a total of over 30,000 farmers trained.</Description>

<Description>Autonomous Treatment Centre providing integrated primary health care, maternity, TB and HIV testing, care, and treatment. In October 2006, Right To Care (RTC) expanded support of Ndlovu Medical Trust (NMT) to include a new Autonomous Treatment Centre, Bhubezi.  In 2006, a unique partnership with NMT, Anglo Coal, and Virgin Unite Foundation was formed to provide HIV treatment and primary health care in the community.  Sub-recipient funds through RTC include drugs, pathology, human resources, and infrastructure, including the purchase of digital x-ray machine and rural ambulance.  Anglo Coal and Virgin Unite both contributed towards the construction of the clinic buildings.  The first patients were seen in April 2007 and, within a few months, there were more than 400 patients on HIV treatment.  The site continues to grow rapidly, meeting the needs of the remote and previously underserved community.  Discussions have been started with the Department of Health in Mpumalanga for the accreditation of the site as an ARV roll-out, as other clinics within 50-100 km are not capable to provide ARVs.</Description>

This program was formed at the request of the NWDOH to down-refer stable ART patients from NWDOH facilities to private GPs for ongoing care, support, and ART follow-up, thereby increasing the capacity of the NWDOH facility to initiate more ART patients and care for complicated cases.  The SAG provides the ART medications and lab costs, while PEPFAR covers a capitated payment to private GPs, quality and clinical outcomes monitoring, training and patient adherence support.  The private GPs provide an in-kind contribution through reduced fees and providing clinical space. Moreover, this program was designed to be sustainable post PEPFAR as NWDOH worked with BRHC to negotiate the GP capitated rate at a level which NWDOH can afford to sustain.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Building Communities to Foster Youth Development  (Glasswing Foundation)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Crisálida develops the project: “Building Communities to Foster Youth Development” using an innovative model for the private sector to invest and integrate into the communities and public schools. The project strives to: 1) create clean, safe public spaces where students are actively learning for longer periods of time and 2) mobilize individuals to become volunteer educators in extracurricular activities to keep children safe and prevent violence in the community. Crisálida has 4 main goals:   Fix school infrastructure   Ensure participation of 40 volunteers per school  Expand student’s hours of enrichment and learning  Long-term collaboration and integration between companies and surrounding communities.    The USAID/Fundación Crisalida project focuses on 6 public schools in the following communities: San Salvador, Santa Tecla, Ciudad Arce, San Juan Opico. During the 18 month project period, Crisálida will implement programs ranging from Level I to Level III. Level I being the highest level of involvement between community, private sector, and public sector in each school.   USAID funds will cover 4 Level I school programs: Refugio de La Paz, Santa Tecla; San Antonio Abad, San Salvador; República de Canadá, Las Palmas and Lomas de Santiago, San Juan Opico.  And 2 Level II school programs: San Francisco Zapotitán, Ciudad Arce and Las Flores, San Juan Opico,  With funds from the private sector, Crisálida will also be working on 10 public schools at a Level III program.    Level I schools will benefit from a package that offers the opportunity to: 1)revitalize and improve their infrastructure through corporate-sponsored volunteer projects that engage both company and community volunteers, 2) involve students in after school activities that offer a range of topics such as computing, English and art/music, 3) initiate parental and community initiatives, 4) provide a mentoring program for at-risk students, 5) revitalize safe community spaces for youth and 6) connect corporate volunteers to school personnel in areas such as  human resources and finance. With these projects more than 4,000 students and parents and other community members, will benefit.    For some activities, such as changing roofs, construction/fixing of classrooms, kitchen, bathrooms or playgrounds at schools, Crisálida is required to develop an Environmental Mitigation Plan. USAID is guiding field reviews and approving environmental guides prior to implementing these activities.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Cafta Alliance for Capacity Building</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>On 29 September 2003 the USAID/G-CAP Mission Director approved the CAFTA-DR Alliance to support sustainable development in the Central America countries by improving their export infrastructure.  On September 29, 2005 a nine-month extension was approved.  The results achieved show that this alliance has built a strong network of local partners and government counterparts in support of trade capacity building efforts in the region.  This alliance has also established a regional NGO (“Global Alliance for Humane Sustainable Development”) in San Jose, Costa Rica, to implement activities and foster the relationships and dialogue with the CAFTA-DR countries and their Ministries of Trade, Agriculture, and Environment and to work with regional Ministerial policy-making institutions.  The alliance worked with each of the five Central American countries, held workshops and training, analyzed laws, and provided assistance in the production and marketing of organic food products with the United States.  This program included activities to improve decision-making in sustainable agriculture in Central America by establishing systems for humane treatment of animals and environmental sustainability that promote rural development, domestic markets and market opportunities in the United States.  The activities implemented include a rural veterinary service program established in the Costa Rican national park “El Tortuguero” which handled over 1,000 stray animals and protected a highly-visited tourism destination, while contributing to turtle conservation efforts.  This area is well known as an important breeding ground in Central America for four of the seven existing sea turtle species, and is an important tourism destination that receives over 40,000 visitors yearly.  This activity has increased community incomes from tourism as a result of the turtle conservation.  Ten communities in the department of Peten in Guatemala have developed their own veterinary care assistance program, supplemented by an educational campaign to provide sustainable care for animals and wildlife in the surrounding communities.  Costa Rica’s livestock industry established a five-year plan for implementing animal welfare in the beef sector.  The Nicaraguan livestock industry also targeted training and technical assistance in order to comply with animal welfare standards that can improve the production and final meat quality.  El Salvador and Guatemala have requested technical assistance in this field.  A core group of Central American experts is receiving technical assistance to address animal welfare concerns in assistance programs for the private sector, government and the academia.  The program improved the customs regimes to: ensure more humane systems in each of the CAFTA-DR countries; permit a more efficient flow of goods between the United States and the CAFTA-DR countries; and eradicate illicit activities.  The government of Guatemala and local NGOs organized a regional seminar on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the illegal trade of wildlife, which had more than 50 attendees.  They developed a strategy to improve compliance with CITES and the humane handling and manipulation of confiscated wildlife.  Activities under this alliance ended on September 30, 2005.</Description>

<Description>Central America is still recovering from decades of civil conflict and dealing with spiraling crime and widespread poverty. Four countries in the region suffered from military-controlled regimes and over a quarter of a million lives were lost in Cold War-related conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1990s, Central America’s annual average GDP growth rate was around 1.6%, less than population growth. The economic situation has worsened due to combined fall-out from a decline in coffee prices and the global economic slowdown. The result is a social crisis with increases in chronic malnutrition, gang violence, and a proliferation of organized criminal activities such as drug smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Certified Sustainable Products Alliance (CSPA)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>&quot;The alliance objective is to increase the volume and value of sales for key certified products to improve rural livelihoods and well-being in Central America and Mexico by: increasing market access for certified products; improving environmental management; and expanding the sustainable certification process for improved producer competitiveness.  The results achieved in the 10/04 to 10/05 period fell into three categories.



Coffee: This year the project had tremendous success in making certified coffee widely available to consumers.  Overall sales of Rainforest Alliance certified coffee from CSPA countries increased from 5,000 to 8,700 metric tons.  Gross sales of certified coffee from the region grew from $12 million/year to $21 million/year.  Kraft Foods launched certified products in four countries (The United States, The United Kingdom, France and Sweden).  A delegation of senior Kraft executives visited certified coffee farms in El Salvador in January.  Kraft buys about 40% of El Salvador’s certified coffee.  Demand within the various Kraft brands has grown so quickly that they have purchased more than they have committed to each year, and expect to nearly double their purchases again in FY 2006.  The Rainforest Alliance developed public information materials in English, Spanish, French, German, Swedish and Japanese.  Media outreach in Europe and the U.K. resulted in substantial press coverage of certified products.  Also, Rainforest Alliance created Web pages about sustainable coffee (http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/cafe) in Spanish, French and German.  In the past six months, our coffee page in French has been viewed 1700 times; in Spanish, 700 times; in German, 300 times.  In addition to Kraft we strengthened key relationships with buyers in Japan, Europe, the United States and Canada.  UCC Japan, Gloria Jean’s, Diedrichs Coffees, Timothy’s World Coffee, Mayorga Coffee Roasters, Caribou Coffee, Matthew Algie, Lavazza, and Gala Coffee &amp; Tea are undertaking substantial promotions of their Rainforest Alliance certified coffee products.  In FY05 the total hectares of certified coffee grew from 18,148 to 32,827.  This growth was accomplished by training 159 extensionists / internal auditors and 24 new certification auditors, and by providing advanced training to 25 existing auditors.  In addition, a substantial number of farms received diagnostic audits, which leaves us poised too nearly to a need for substantial growth in certified hectares in FY06 to fill the increasing demand.



Bananas: In FY05 we had an increase of 22% in sales of boxes of certified bananas, resulting in gross sales of $97,328,243.  Growth in total hectares certified varied by country.  Some countries had substantial growth, such as Guatemala and Honduras, while other countries saw a cutback in certified production (Costa Rica and Panama).  The end result was a 5% increase in total hectares certified.  After 13 years of effort and unprecedented changes, Chiquita introduced Rainforest Alliance Certified bananas in nine European countries.  Half of the company’s European supply is wearing the seal of approval--500,000 boxes or about 50 million individual bananas a week in supermarkets throughout the region.  Rainforest Alliance and SAN staff supported Chiquita in nine launch events in Europe, one in each country.  These launch events entail substantial work from the communications team and European representatives, including developing the materials and message, planning the events, stakeholder mapping and meetings prior to the launch, developing articles that would run in the media before the official announcement, and substantial follow up with media and stakeholders after the launch.  This results in a large number of stories in the press.  We also created Web pages about sustainable banana farms (http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/banano) in Spanish, Swedish and German.  Much of the increase in certified hectares i&quot;</Description>

<Description>Currently most Afghan marble is being exported in blocks as raw materials. Today, most marble processing operations are using low quality and outdated processing technology which yields low quality finished products which are not meeting the demand of the international marble buyers.  Specifically, Afghan marble processing plants cut narrow strips singly using a gang-saw. These strips are limited in their usefulness for tiles and cladding. ASMED supported the Chesht Marble Processing Plant through a GDA ($400,000) for procurement of a complete processing plant of Gaspari-Manotti equipment. Through this project the company is able to produce and sell export quality finished tiles and instead of blocks. The factory is now a model for other factories and can be used as training center. It was a major step for the marble sector and will increase awareness of Afghanistan marble in the foreign market and investors. 150 permanent and 15 part time jobs were created through implementation of this project</Description>

<Description>The Program provided technical assistance to identify better and worst agricultural practices in pineapple and watermelon and eco-efficiency in the fresh fruit packing process. Once the baseline was built, a number of improved practices at field and plant level were implemented in pilot plots and finally, the environmental, labor and financial impacts were quantified (still under construction). This alliance has actively being engaged in developing a decision support system known as “Agro-weather Monitoring System for Centro America”. This system uses state of the art information and communications technologies as essential tools to provide, in the short run, support for farm operators’ day-to-day management decisions. This system is being configured to have the following characteristics:    1. Basic network of weather stations equipped with rain, air temperature and relative humidity sensors. These devices were purchased from ADCON Telemetry.  2. At least four weather stations have been installed in four the Chiquita producers sites.  3. The stations are connected via a transceiver (RTU) connected to the local GSM/GPRS service available.  4. Data for these parameters are collected every 15 min and sent to the server at La Lima Honduras every two hours. The Server uses Linux Debian distribution as OS.  5. At La Lima, the data is processed using a pro-server unit (A840), connected to the server that upload the data into a user friendly public website    All stations are fully operative and collecting data as expected since the second quarter of 2010, and can be accessed readily. The initiative is focused on the development and deployment of better agricultural management practices using weather monitoring, building forecasting models and distributing early warning alarms to farm operators that are addressing information for the following aspects:     a) In coordination with melon farm operator managers Configure the early warning alarms for Powdery Mildew management.  b) Water use optimization, through soils and plant humidity sensors to build the irrigation plans  c) Cleaner production techniques in packing plants, including energy efficiency and water use       Acquisition of more agro-weather stations and addition of more weather sensors will enhance the predictive capabilities of the models due to a better space an determinants coverage of the crop areas, and a concomitant increase in precision of the forecasted values for disease and pest indexes and as well as an increase water use efficiency recommendation.     In addition, the alliance are developing custom-tailored workshops to teach the principles of data collection and generation of information and knowledge will promote the early and sustainable adoption of better management practices for pesticide reduction and water use efficiency.</Description>

<Description>To foster vigorous and better-informed participation of Georgian community groups, NGOs and media outlets in their communities’ political and economic decision-making.  The Georgian NGO Civic Education Youth Center implemented a project called Civic Monitoring for Agricultural Development.  The monitoring of the privatization of state-owned agricultural lands revealed several loopholes in the new legislation and the Presidential Decree 525 regulating the privatization of agricultural lands.  This evidence, in combination with information collected through meetings with communities, showed that the loopholes in the privatization legislation created problems for many renters of privatized land.  The communities of Kvareli and Sighnaghi were educated about these shortcomings, and the grantee is preparing recommendations to correct the loopholes, which will be submitted to the Parliament. (Implemented by Eurasia Foundation Small Grants and South Caucasus Cooperation Program.)</Description>

<Description>USAID/South Africa is partnering with the National Planning Commission (NPC) of the Republic of South Africa and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab for Africa (J-PAL) with the objective of generating a body of evidence that can help inform more effective policy interventions aimed at addressing the country’s high levels of youth unemployment. The purpose of this proposed alliance is to advance evidence-based and scalable policy solutions to South Africa’s youth unemployment crisis. The alliance will leverage university, government, private sector, and foundation resources to provide a public good – rigorous evidence about the cost effectiveness of different policy interventions. The partnership will be centered around the initiation of a series of randomized control trials to deepen our understanding of the functioning (and disfunctioning) of the South African labor markets and to test the comparative cost effectiveness of different policy options to actively promote youth employment.  This evidence will feed directly into South African policy making at the highest levels via the National Planning Commission (NPC), giving this alliance the real potential to impact all of South Africa’s 48 million residents.  This approach also fits neatly with USAID/Southern Africa’s strategy of creating an enabling environment for increasing employment.</Description>

<Description>The project will build on local and national initiatives in the fight against trafficking in persons by strengthening the enabling environment and improving the implementation of the anti-trafficking legislation. The project will maintain a database for the monitoring and documentation of trafficking in the Philippines; sustain joint anti-trafficking initiatives with local NGOs; and expand support for the campaign against trafficking at the community, national and international levels.  The project Solidarity Center aimed at improving the capacity of government, non-government organizations and community support groups at the national and local levels to generate reliable, on-the-ground information and maintain a centralized database on trafficking-related cases. It also aimed at strengthening the cooperation among government entities, trade unions and other non-government organizations in destination and source communities in monitoring and documentation to effectively initiate cases and take direct action including rescue, repatriation and rehabilitation of trafficking victims. Through the funding support from the US Department of State, the Solidarity Center will maintain the database and monitoring system of trafficking information from the village to the national level and conduct regional training programs for selected contact persons to operate and maintain the monitoring system in pilot communities. It will conduct a series of trafficking in persons orientation and information dissemination activities to its network of anti-trafficking groups and organizations, specifically targeting employers and trade unions in transportation and informal sector at ports and terminals in order to develop cooperation mechanisms in disseminating anti-trafficking messages, monitoring and reporting trafficking cases, modes and trafficking routes.</Description>

<Description>The goal of the project is to reduce trade in illegal and unsustainably harvested natural resource products in Cambodia and Thailand, and it ended in FY 2005.  This goal will be achieved by raising awareness and creating social incentives for citizens to participate in biodiversity and conservation, and by strengthening the capacity of government agencies in Cambodia and Thailand to enforce protected area and wildlife trade laws.  These objectives will be achieved by raising awareness among the general  public in the region about the problem of biodiversity loss and its link to illegal trade; providing an incentive and mechanism for the general public to participate in biodiversity conservation through sharing information on illegal trade with the government and NGO sectors, and by building capacity within enforcement units to safeguard wildlife in protected areas and to interrupt and apprehend illegal traders once they have extracted poached wild animals and plants from protected areas. Wild Aid&apos;s organizational goal is a 50% reduction in the illegal trade in nature products in the next 5 years.  This project will contribute significantly to this overall goal by enabling Wild Aid and the government and private sector partners to greatly deter would-be traffickers in two of the most highly traveled routes for wildlife trade transport.  The project will, at the same time, enable governments to improve their capacity to protect wildlife and its habitat through training and exchange programs.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Commercialization of Energy Efficiency Project</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Commercialization of Energy Efficiency project (CEEP) is a three-year activity targeted at advancing improvement of efficiency in the sector and promoting energy efficiency technologies.  CEEP marks a shift from energy efficiency demonstration pilot projects under earlier USAID activities toward commercially-oriented energy efficiency with local financing.  The key objectives of the program are: increasing the use of clean, safe and technologies by residential, commercial, industrial and municipal energy consumers, by increasing the availability of locally obtainable financing for energy efficiency projects; and conducting a limited number of socially-oriented energy efficiency projects, thus preparing the sector for energy price increases expected in Armenia in coming years.  To achieve these goals, the Program works with multiple stakeholders from different sectors: local energy efficiency business providers, vendors, manufacturers of equipment, local financial institutions, and other entities from public and private sectors to increase their interest in energy efficiency technologies.  Part of the CEEP program is the implementation of socially-oriented energy efficiency activities supporting educational, medical and other socially important institutions that have limited financial resources.  The objective is to induce other institutions of this kind to raise funds for the implementation of energy efficiency improvements with their own resources.  An important aspect is the feasibility of such projects from the economic point of view.  Under this sub-component of CEEP, the Contractor must develop and implement a limited number of socially-oriented energy efficiency projects in hospitals, kindergartens, special schools, and other social welfare and health institutions; and that demo-projects should demonstrate the viability and potential for replication of various energy efficiency technologies in Armenia.  This is done in cooperation with beneficiaries and other donors or charitable organizations active in Armenia.  Selection of projects for implementation must be done on a competitive basis, with evaluation criteria considering the projected energy savings, proposed application of new technologies, rate of return on investment, social factors and other relevant factors, as well as cost share.  Private cost-share ranges from 30 % to 50% of the total project cost.</Description>

<Description>The aim of this alliance is to improve the health and lives of people in Egypt through developing and implementing action-oriented and sustainable programs that result in measurable behavioral change and improved health status in areas of: maternal and child health; healthy lifestyles, as related to the health and welfare of mother and baby; and family planning and reproductive health.  The various partners have important contributions: Procter &amp; Gamble’s “Youm Wara Youm” on Negoum FM Radio will air radio programs presented by a medical doctor considered a “baby” expert; there will be 3-4 minute daily “health tips” radio programs; and an hour-long weekly health education radio show.  To prevent the spread of viral hepatitis, EFG Hermes will undertake a Viral Hepatitis Campaign Sponsorship, a campaign which will be conducted on university campuses to increase knowledge of and preventative behaviors for viral hepatitis.  At each university, the campaign will consist of a set of concentrated activities on campus, including large-scale events, media participation, health seminars, information booths, awards, health communication materials, and hepatitis B vaccinations.  United Company for Pharmacists/Middle East for Chemicals (UCP/MEC), the major pharmaceutical distributor with 44% market share, will partner Ask, Consult (AC), part of Communication For Healthy Living Project funded by USAID and implemented by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Communication Programs.  AC is a national branding and marketing program with a national network of 30,000 private sector pharmacies.  AC grows the Market for Health through different strategies, including an integrated marketing campaign for private pharmacists to build their capacity to be a credible source of proper health information and good sources of referral.  The UCP/MEC partnership supports AC to build its network.  One of UCP/MEC roles to support AC is the distribution of Ask Consult Hepatitis &amp; AI educational materials to 30,000 pharmacies in an efficient way.  Roche  will combat viral hepatitis by producing radio tips on virus C that will be aired on Negoum FM as part of the viral hepatitis initiative.  It is planned to produce these radio tips promoting positive health behaviors for the general public in the virus C prevention that would include: safe injection, hygiene, and promotion of the viral hepatitis hotline.  The tips will be aired on Negoum FM, and possibly on local radio.  Orascom Telecom will join this campaign against viral hepatitis by subsidizing vaccinations and any other activities in the University Campaign to Prevent Viral Hepatitis.  There will also be in-kind donation of SMS services to send text messages to vaccinated students reminding them when booster shots are due.  Part of the University Campaign to Prevent Viral Hepatitis will be to donate and discount vaccinations and booster shots for university students.  The campaign consists of concentrated activities on each campus including large-scale events, media participation, health seminars, information booths, awards, health communication materials, and hepatitis B vaccinations.  B-Connect is a leader in automation of the health-care sector, including pharmacies.  B-Connect has provided computer software, expertise, and capital to the AskConsult program.</Description>

<Description>The objective of the partnership is to involve the private sector, local authorities, civil society organizations to address citizen security issues in high risk communities, plan and implement prevention activities, and measure the impact of interventions. Despite progress toward stability and democracy, El Salvador suffers from high levels of crime and violence that undermine citizen security and retard economic development, eventually eroding democratic values.  Gangs have been a salient feature, but the sources of insecurity are not limited to them.  It has become clear that strengthening law enforcement alone is insufficient to resolve the problem, and that a combination of prevention and law enforcement, with active involvement of communities, civil society, and the private sector, is required to satisfactorily reduce crime and violence, and rebuild citizen confidence.  USAID partners with these local actors to implement a variety of prevention projects, including vocational training, entrepreneurship courses for youth; rehabilitation of public spaces and recreational facilities; and educational and sports programs.</Description>

<Description>USAID and partners test innovations in value-added wood processing and marketing high-value wood products.  The alliance seeks to help the community cut fewer trees and gain greater income by establishing businesses in secondary processing that bring a much greater share of the final value back to the community and its landowners.  By including Peace Corps, past USAID partners, and local community members, the likelihood of success increases as the responsibility of success is shared among all levels of institutions.  The alliance also presents an element of &quot;checks and balances&quot; among the community to ensure that social/political issues do not jeopardize the success of the project.  The Jatun Sacha technical capability and the Pinchot Institute participation provide advantages in areas that sometimes become the constraints for project implementation, i.e., commercialization and markets.  To date, the construction of the solar-powered kiln is complete and the community is producing small boxes for handcrafts and paneled doors for the local market.  There are willing buyers for the wood products and other markets are opening up for flooring, molding, siding and structural beams.  Commitments remain high within the community of Cristobal Colon, and among the partners implementing this program.  Two indigenous groups have expressed interest in this model.  As a result, the Peace Corps is planning to place volunteers in these communities to replicate the project.</Description>

<Description>In support of GPH MDGs for maternal and child health, the PPP with midwives (MWs) aims to expand and strengthen the role of public and private MWs in the national strategy for family planning and maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition (FP/MNCHN). The PPP with MWs seeks to increase the number of PhilHealth-accredited privately operated birthing homes and midwives to expand access of underserved populations to quality FP/MCH services. The stringent PhilHealth accreditation process for maternal care package (MCP) sets the country’s standard for quality midwifery care. The increase in PhilHealth MCP accredited birthing facilities expands the avenues for social health financing. 

Assistance to midwives to qualify for PhilHealth accreditation includes clinical skills training and post-training mentoring in essential intrapartum and newborn care, ante-natal care, lactation management, and FP. Other technical assistance includes facilitation of referral arrangements within the GPH’s Service Delivery Network, and advocacy for supportive national and local policies.  To sustain provision of quality midwifery training, the PPP for MWs  works on strengthening the capacities of midwifery schools and other academic institutions, training and mentoring with professional associations, and in organizational and institutional governance.</Description>

<Description>This public-private partnership aims to train a cadre of health care professionals in state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS treatment and care so that they can serve as experts and leaders in the field.  Its funding partner is Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GSK), while its implementing partner is the American International Health Alliance (AIHA)  This partnership brings the global pharmaceutical company Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GSK) together with the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to further the professional development of Russian medical specialists in regions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Under the project, a core group of clinical leaders will be trained through an intensive two-year fellowship program that will significantly enhance their clinical expertise in HIV medicine.  Participants in the fellowship program are selected based on their qualifications and potential to become future leading authorities in the HIV/AIDS field.  In particular, their ability and will to educate others—to provide peers with the knowledge and advice needed to build the overall capacity of the Russian HIV-related medical sector—is considered.  The project will use an interactive Russian-language Web portal, developed under the EurasiaHealth project, to allow medical professionals to share best practices and to access a library of the latest resources, including treatment guidelines and protocols, textbooks, training materials, and clinical case studies.  GlaxoSmithKline and the implementing partner, the American International Health Alliance (AIHA), selected 18 outstanding HIV professionals on a competitive basis to form the core group of experts.  As of July 2008, two training workshops had been conducted and the web site had become operational.  In addition, AIHA piloted a six-week distance learning course during which 5 clinical case studies were actively discussed online by the selected professionals.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Community Support for HIV-Infected Street Children</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This public-private partnership aims to provide shelter and treatment for over 3,800 HIV-positive street children and youths in St. Petersburg.  Its funding partners include: Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporation; M.A.C. AIDS Fund; St. Petersburg AIDS Center; St. Petersburg City Administration; and the World Childhood Foundation.  Implementing partners include Doctors of the World-USA and Doctors to Children  This partnership strives to meet the needs of the growing numbers of HIV-positive children and youths living on the streets in St. Petersburg.  Current estimates indicate that there are up to 10,000 of them, many of whom succumb to drug abuse and prostitution.  Recent studies have demonstrated extremely high rates of HIV transmission (37.4%) among the city’s street youth, with 84% of transmissions a result of injecting drug use.  It is very difficult for HIV-positive street youth to access clinical care and prevention services and to adhere to anti-retroviral treatment, making this group more likely to transmit HIV to others and more vulnerable to HIV-related illness and death.  Building on the success of the first municipal Drop-In Center (DIC) for street children and youths, launched in April 2005 under another USAID project, Doctors of the World-USA and the Frunzensky District of St. Petersburg initiated this partnership to expand the DIC’s walk-in services.  Under this project, the DIC will improve access to services by providing 24 hour care and establishing crisis wards (an overnight shelter) for HIV-positive youth to enable them to register with the AIDS Center and become eligible for anti-retroviral treatment.  Since its inception in October 2006, 122 male and 92 female youths (aged 10-21) have spent a total of 1,698 nights in crisis wards.  These HIV-positive youths have benefited from services such as emergency medical and psychological assistance, hygiene services, and referrals to social and health care.  As a result of short-term rehabilitative support, 136 HIV-positive children have received access to treatment at the AIDS Center, and 83 of them have enrolled in an anti-retroviral treatment program.</Description>

<Description>The Conflict Mitigation and Management program targets the conflict-intensive province of Cabinda and is working to support sustainable peace and national reconciliation by working with Cabindans to transform their society away from a culture of violence to one characterized by coexistence, security, social justice, and popular participation. The program is strengthening social cohesion within and among different sectors of the Cabindan society, and empowering Cabindans to more fully participate in Angola’s political, economic, and social development Cabinda’s enduring conflict has produced multiple lines of fracture: between Luanda and the province; between secessionist and pro-Luanda factions within Cabinda; between the military and police and the populace; between the four tribal groups in the province; and between the government and the people. In addition, past oil spills and unmet expectations have created conflict between local communities, particularly along the coast, and Chevron. The program has initiated activities that target participants at the Government, civil society, and community levels of society. In addition, this project has been developed with the support of Chevron, which represents one of the first cases of an oil company proactively seeking to positively influence a conflict environment with specific skill building and community engagement projects The program is working in three municipalities in Cabinda province: Cabinda, Cacongo and Buco Zau.</Description>

This will help to foster the growth of trans-national African communications carriers and encourage an environment that will eventually help Africa achieve internet pricing that is in line with the global market, rather then the excessive costs that exist at present.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Cordillera Azul National Park</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The USAID investment of $5,250,000 over four years is part of a coordinated series of programs totaling--$10,145,000--that offer local communities long-term, stable alternatives to illicit plantations in the lands adjacent to the Cordillera Azul National Park.  This activity will implement park infrastructure, policy, and ecologically compatible opportunities for communities neighboring the park.  The Field Museum leveraged funds from private donors to implement activities to sustain resources and promote economic opportunities compatible with the park. By doing this the park will become integral to the economic development of the region as a whole, improving the livelihoods of local residents and playing a central role in the difficult recovery of the Huallaga Ucayali Valleys from the illegal land uses (cocoa and poppy productions, as well as logging) that have destabilized the region.  Program will expire in June 2007.</Description>

<Description>The objective was to engage in &quot;win-win&quot; partnerships to promote products and services that benefit women and children&apos;s/family health. The “Strengthening Family Planning” project or in Arabic, Ta’ziz Tanzim Al Usra (in short, Ta’ziz), aims to expand the availability, quality and use of family planning (FP) services through partnership with the private, non-governmental sector in Jordan. Ta’ziz and corporate and NGO partners agreed to engage in “co-promotion” during events and activities organized by the mutual concerns.  Ta’ziz has offered corporate and NGO partners the opportunity to promote their products and services while providing giveaways to patrons attending “road shows&quot; and lectures at UNRWA women’s centers implemented under the national oral contraceptive pill campaign co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Higher Population Council, and Jordan Association for Family Planning and Protection (JAFPP), and “family fairs” at JAFPP clinics. The corporate and NGO partners on the other hand have offered Ta’ziz an opportunity to provide orientations and distribute educational materials that promote the use of modern contraceptive methods during the partners&apos; sponsored events and activities, e.g. at hospitals.</Description>

<Description>The overarching goal of the project is to increase philanthropic activities among businesses in Ukraine through innovative practices which reinforce the principles of openness and transparency.  As donor funding decreases in the years ahead, CSOs will increasingly be required to seek funding locally to ensure their survival.  Fortunately, Ukrainian corporations are beginning to explore ways to support worthy causes.  By introducing concrete mechanisms by which businesses can further develop and sustain philanthropic activities in an open and transparent manner, this project helps to ensure the continued existence of a strong and vibrant civil society--a civil society which can provide critical social services, represent citizens’ interests, and work alongside business and government in defining the future of a stable, prosperous and democratic Ukraine.</Description>

<Description>This program aimed to promote the social engagement of private companies in addressing Georgia’s development needs.  The highlight of the program was the Corporate Social Investments: a New Model of Partnerships conference, which convened 70 participants from the business community, government, non-profits, and donor organizations.  The conference opening session discussed global trends in corporate citizenship and how these trends are developing in Georgia.  In the afternoon, participants broke up into two groups, one for company representatives, and the other for non-profits and donor organizations.  British CSI experts conducted the workshop for company representatives and covered topics such as why companies should get involved in CSI and what international models of CSI can be applied in the Georgian context.  Company representatives discussed programs that their companies currently have or are planning to start.  The parallel session involving non-profits and government representatives presented various legal frameworks that promote private donations to the non-profit sector.  The experts from Hungary, Ukraine, and Russia presented pros and cons of legal frameworks that exist in their countries.  Georgian experts presented an analysis of the impact of the recently introduced tax benefits on giving patterns.  The session also provided a venue for the discussion of a draft of a law on endowments, which was developed by a group of Georgian universities.  The conference was a collaborative effort of three donor organizations, EPF, British Council, and the Open Society-Georgia Foundation.  In addition, European Center for Non-for-Profit Law partially covered the participation of Hungarian experts.  (Implemented by Eurasia Foundation Small Grants and South Caucasus Cooperation Program.)</Description>

<Description>This crop improvement project will contribute to increasing the productivity and sustainability of rice and wheat systems in South Asia.  Drought, salinity and nitrogen availability are constraints to rice and wheat production in South Asia, a region with almost 1.5 billion people and high rates of poverty and malnutrition.  Furthermore, most climate change scenarios indicate that climatic conditions will become more variable in the future, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to meet demand for these staple crops.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Accelerating  21st Century Education (ACE)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The ACE Alliance (2010-2012), a USAID partnership with Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and Kenya’s Ministry of Education, emerged from the ICT in Education Global Development Alliance, as part of USAID’s broader Teacher Education and Professional Development (TEPD) program. The ACE Alliance deployed ICT in education by providing affordable PCs and Internet access solutions, integrated ICT in teaching, and the use of locally relevant content, software, and services. A key component was the creation of “one-to-one-learning” classrooms in 60 focus schools across Kenya, in which every student gained access to a computer. Total project investment reached $9 million.

Deploying more than 6,000 networked computers for student and teacher use, ACE trained approximately 7,000 teachers to integrate technology into the classroom, trained technical support staff at each school to maintain the technology, provided schools with a wireless infrastructure and access to digital education content, and developed the local ICT industry to promote economic development and sustainability. The project also trained 2,000 teachers and 5,000 pre-service teachers at training colleges to teach in 40 secondary school and 40 primary schools across Kenya. Over three years, the ACE project has directly benefited about 39,000 students, while Kenya’s Ministry of Education estimated that an additional 300,000 people are benefiting from it indirectly.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Alfalit International - Liberia</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objective is to promote literacy in poor rural areas, especially among women, to help adults lead economically productive lives.  Readings on malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, first aid, nutrition, and building solar cookers help introduce life skills and inspire adult students to want to read in order to improve their lives.   Background and Results: Alfalit International - Liberia, Inc. is a faith-based, non-demoninational, non-profit, grassroots organization, that provides literacy and numeracy education to Liberia&apos;s most needy citizens.  Alfalit - Liberia was established in 2006, and in its first year reached over 1,600 illiterate Liberians, the majority of whom were women.  In 2007, USAID provided roughly $500,000 through the President&apos;s Africa Education Initiative to adapt, print, transport, and deliver books and educational materials to Liberia for 24,000 future adult learners and 1,000 teacher facilitators.  Through the partnership with USAID, Alfalit - Liberia has enrolled 7,177 students, most of whom are women.    This project models the type of public-private partnership USAID seeks to promote, by leveraging USG funding with local community contributions (space for classes and volunteer teachers/facilitators) and private funding (provided by Alfalit and its private donors) for training workshops, generators, transportation, and all other program implementation costs.    Alfalit tends to focus its work in very poor areas and communities that are the most difficult to reach, often communities distant from the main roads.  It uses churches, schools, and other spaces provided free of charge by local communities.  Alfalit also trains local community members to be teachers and facilitators in their own community, and works with community leaders to support and cultivate interest in its programs.  The program&apos;s books contain stories that cultivate a culture of life-long learning in which characters are involved in a literacy program and encourage their families and friends to join literacy courses and work together to master basic education skills as part of an ethical, hard working, and economically productive life.  Readings on malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, first aid, nutrition, and even building solar cookers help introduce life skills and inspire students to want to read as a tool to readily improve their lives.</Description>

<Description>To leverage and combine private sector experience and resources with those of USAID in order to achieve education goals and increase financial support for education as well as promote sustainable human development in the region of Cajamarca. The objective was to work, in conjunction with the Regional Government of Cajamarca, to improve education outcomes and school enrollment in the region, making use of mining proceeds to have an impact beyond the mining operations themselves.   Activities were to include technical assistance to the Regional Government of Cajamarca to increase budget expenditures on education in connection with increased student achievement (PELA); developing an in-service teacher training system; and strengthening civil society participation in education, to name a few.  The partnership is still in its initial stages, suffering from delays in implementation due to social and political unrest (e.g., strikes) relating to mining.  Hereto, alliance parties have agreed that the project activities will be implemented in 26 education institutions in 9 target districts where PELA is implemented in Cajamarca.  The education model to be implemented is Escuelas Exitosas, a student-centric approach that also focuses on training teachers in a proprietary teaching pedagogy.  It is unclear if and/or how the social and political unrest might affect continued implementation and/or achievement of project activities and results.</Description>

<Description>Alianzas (2005-2010), a USAID partnership with MNCs, local firms, NGOs, and faith-based organizations, implemented by RTI International, leveraged private sector resources to improve health, nutrition, education, and post-disaster reconstruction in Guatemala, engaging national and multi-national companies to demonstrate the benefits of sustainable development. This partnership had several key achievements through the formation of 104 individual private sector alliances: providing more than 100,000 scholarships, delivering over 150,000 textbooks, installation of 80 computer labs, training approximately 7,500 teachers, and training more than 5,000 health providers. In addition, more than 350,000 people received reproductive health and family planning informational messages, 26,000 mothers and 22,000 children took part in a maternal/child health program, over 46,000 people gained access to safe water after Tropical Storm Stan, and 7.4 million Guatemalans received vaccines to eradicate measles and rubella. The project surpassed USAID’s target leverage of 2:1 to reach 3:1, demonstrating the private sector’s commitment to improving health and education. Total project investment reached $24.6 million, with USAID putting in $6 million, and partners investing $18.6 million. Following the end of Alianzas in 2010, RTI implemented a follow-up project to run until 2014, continuing the work of the original alliance.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Alliance for Methane Emission Reduction</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The goal of this regional partnership between USAID/Ukraine, USAID/Russia and EnCon Services International, LLC is to develop a new mechanism for energy efficiency and environmental project financing based on the use of insurance to provide assurance that the methane emission reductions will be achieved, and therefore the investors will have assets that can be monetized, allowing the project to obtain critical cash at the start of the project. The key challenge that faces energy efficiency and environmental projects in an emerging market is obtaining timely and sufficient financing.  Currently, while the market for emission reductions is growing, it is starved for new and high quality emission reductions.  Finding a new mechanism for financing these important projects will expand the market and allow greater emission reductions from Methane-to-Markets related projects.  To address this problem, the Alliance will develop a new mechanism for project financing based on the use of insurance to provide assurance that the methane emission reductions will be achieved, and therefore the investors will have assets that can be monetized, allowing the project to obtain critical cash at the start of the project.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Antamina Association and the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative- CGSGI (Ancash Economic Service Center)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Objective: to fund a business promotion bureau known as an Economic Service Center (ESC) in the Peruvian Department of Ancash for the January 1, 2010-December 31, 2011 period. The Ancash ESC is operated in accordance with the guidelines and norms of the New Private Sector Competitiveness and Poverty Reduction and Alleviation Activity (also known as PRA Project) financed and managed by USAID through its implementation contract operated by Chemonics International. As part of its methodology, the Project finances the operation of ten ESCs in specific highland and jungle areas of Peru that have high levels of poverty as well as clear potential for economic growth (these areas are called economic corridors). Antamina financed 60.15% of the operational costs of the Ancash ESC, and CGSGI financed 20% of them. Through the PRA contract, USAID (1) finances the management and oversight of the Ancash ESC and (2) finances 19.81% of the operational costs of the Ancash ESC during the support period.   CONTRIBUTION AS FOLLOWS:  Antamina $ 1,109,180 and Clinton $ 331,397. NOTE: Investments for this partnership are excluded here, as they are included under the umbrealla &quot;Poverty Reduction and Alleviation (PRA) - Economic Service Centers (EGE)&quot; entry.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Anti-Money Laundering Training</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>&quot;This public-private partnership supports the development of anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism policies and procedures in Russia.  

Combating money laundering and financing of terrorism is a top priority for security forces and regulators around the world.  Through this partnership, the United States and Russia are collaborating on international efforts to stem the flow of illicit funds into the world’s financial systems. 
This public-private partnership supports the development of anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism policies and procedures in Russia.  The funding partners are: Citigroup Foundation; Central Bank of Russia (CBR); and Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC), which last is also the implementing partner.  Combating money laundering and financing of terrorism is a top priority for security forces and regulators around the world.  Through this partnership, the United States and Russia are collaborating on international efforts to stem the flow of illicit funds into the world’s financial systems.  Developed in response to a Central Bank of Russia (CBR) request for technical assistance, the project uses training and consulting on international best practices to improve the systems and capacities of financial sector regulators and private financial institutions with the aim of increasing their capacities to detect suspicious transactions, provide for anti-money laundering (AML), and the compliance and audit of combat financing of terrorism (CFT).  The project conducts about a dozen targeted and programmatically-linked events each year, including in-country seminars, bank consultations, customized exchanges, and commentaries on AML-related policies and procedures.  FSVC is also working in cooperation with the National Association of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR); the Eurasian Group for AML/CFT (EAG) Training Center; the Association of Regional Banks “Rossia;” the Russian Microfinance Center (RMC); the U.S. Department of Treasury; the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC); the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  FSVC has provided AML and CFT support to more than 1,260 people from over 770 institutions through the implementation of 21 linked projects. Project activities contributed substantively to the recently-adopted amendments to Russian AML law.
The project assisted Rosfinmonitoring in developing the methodology for preparing AML typologies that, through its adoption by the Eurasia Group for AML/CFT (EAG), will benefit AML systems in all EAG countries.
Based on the strong relations developed with the EAG, the partners are working on expanding the existing GDA to attract more contributing partners and transforming it into a regional program involving other EAG countries.&quot;</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Armenia AIHA</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Operating under a series of cooperative agreements with USAID, AIHA has created a highly successful partnership model to address local, national, and regional healthcare issues in Armenia and foster successful models in the areas of women&apos;s health, primary care, family medicine.  Eight US/Armenian partnerships were a part of this successful program.  The AIHA partnerships began working in Armenia in 1992.  Over the past 12 years, partners from the United States and Armenia have identified the health needs of local populations, developed strategies for meeting those needs, and implemented work plans to improve health indicators and access to services.  The programs developed during these years of collaboration have focused on primary healthcare, maternal and child health, emergency medicine, nursing, community education and outreach, healthcare management, and other areas related to healthcare reform.  Medical and administrative personnel from partnership institutions received extensive training in these specialties and, as in all partnerships, Learning Resource Centers were created to ensure networking among partners, the inflow of information from global healthcare resources, and the adoption of evidence-based medicine.</Description>

<Description>On June 12, 2012 USAID, Vodafone, and TechnoServe announced a new three-year partnership to increase the productivity, incomes, and resilience of smallholder farmers. The Connected Farmer Alliance will leverage mobile phone-enabled solutions to improve supply chain efficiency and increase farmers’ ability to access secure, timely payments and other financial services. Implementation began in September 2012. 
The partnership will reach more than 500,000 smallholder farmers by expanding the use of mobile financial services pioneered by Vodafone’s existing mobile money platform, M-Pesa—a highly successful SMS-based money transfer service already at scale in Kenya where 15 million people exchange $850 million via the system every month. Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania are priorities of Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative, and home to Vodafone affiliate companies. Vodafone and TechnoServe will work with farming communities and supply chains in these countries to develop and scale mobile applications that enable rural households to transfer and receive payments securely, access other financial services, and facilitate linkages to local and multinational agribusinesses, especially those looking to serve smallholder farmers working in Feed the Future priority value chains.</Description>

<Description>In May 2012, USAID/Timor-Leste and ConocoPhillips entered into a partnership to support the expansion of USAID&apos;s Developing Agricultural Communities (DAC) activity into ten new communities in Aileu District. The partnership enabled more than 200 farmers to become participants in DAC training and market linkage activities. As a result of their participation, these farmers have seen their income from horticulture production increase dramatically, in some cases by more than 400%.  In June 2014, USAID and ConcoPhillips expanded the partnership to provide training for farmers in 10 new communities and to assist the development of input suppliers and traders to support the horticulture market in those communities.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Conservation Coffee Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The alliance objectives are to: promote farmer well being, conservation and sustainable production; increase economic benefits to farmers; develop incentives for all actors in the supply chain, and provide consumers an opportunity to contribute to conservation and poverty reduction.  The results achieved for the period from 10/04--09/05 are varied.  CI remains committed to the regional strategy described in the Alliance proposal and to continue developing origin activities in Costa Rica and Panama to achieve conservation through farmers adopting recommended best practices.  At this time Starbucks is not able to buy coffee produced in Costa Rica and Panama, which does not conform to the company’s requirements for volume and quality.  Starbucks’ demand for coffee of Mexican origin continues to be robust.  Availability from the 2005/2006 harvest for its Shade Grown Mexico brand will be lower than projected, owing to the impact of Hurricane Stan.  As to marketing partnerships, CI is re-orienting its marketing strategy to support its local business partners that buy from the farmers and export the coffee.  These partners are AMSA (Mexico), COOPEAGRI (Costa Rica), and DELICAFÉ (Costa Rica and Panama).  CI’s strategy has four elements: to facilitate relations and negotiations between these partners and the producers; to strengthen the capacity of producers and their base-level organizations; to support the marketing messages of the partners, so that they can derive value in the market from the conservation coffee concept; and to identify and contact target clients in the international market.  CI has contracted Canopy Coffee, a consultancy firm operating in the specialty coffee market, to support implementing this strategy.  Regional programs and partners, as well as Starbucks, see this re-orientation as a strengthening development, building independence and a more sustainable program, in which coffee farmed according to the best practices may reach other outlets in the specialty coffee market.  As to the CAFÉ Practices, CI continues to support Starbucks to deliver its commitment to increasing the amount of coffee purchased under CAFÉ Practices.  In September 2005, the Mexico partners applied to enter the system.  CI’s local coordinators support training verifiers.  In August 2005, CI and Starbucks met in Seattle to discuss refinements to the criteria that would strengthen the impact on conservation,  but at this stage Starbucks wants to focus on outreach rather than refinement.  The partners agreed to support this purpose instead by researching and providing guidance to origin projects on: lists of recommended tree species for different uses in coffee; recommended methods for ecological restoration; and environmental legislation that is relevant to coffee practices.  As to origins, origin countries are building strategic partnerships to grow the projects in a sustainable way without CI directly providing services.  The following are examples of these partnerships: in Mexico a new cooperative, UPROSIVI, and independent producers from Reserva de la Sepultura have joined the project; in Costa Rica Fundación Neotropica will provide biological monitoring; and in Panama CI facilitated a stakeholder meeting in September 2005, following which a representative work group is developing best practices based on a study of coffee regions by CI’s partner, INBIO.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Continuous Improvement in the Central American Workplace (CIMCAW)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>On 30 September, 2004, USAID/G-CAP Mission Director approved a multi-stakeholder alliance for U.S.$2 million (U.S.$1.5 million from USAID/G-CAP and $500,000 from the Global Development Alliance Secretariat).  With the active participation of major international apparel companies, this innovative partnership seeks to increase the competitiveness of the apparel and textile industry by improving labor standards at the workplace level.  The achievements for FY2005 include: capacity building for Ministry of Labor Inspectors and private auditors in Nicaragua where Social Accountability International conducted a four-day training for 30 Ministry of Labor Inspectors and private auditors which provided information about codes of conducts and social audits, and also an opportunity to compare various codes of conduct with the national labor laws; successful union workshops held in three countries with 68 key union members to obtain union perspective, buy-in and create a sense of ownership, a program which relied on its partner, the International Textile Garment Leather Workers Federation, to organize two-day workshops for unions with representation in the apparel manufacturing factories in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic; diagnostics completed in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic; diagnostic validation workshops in Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Honduras; identification and confirmation of local partners, namely the Nicaraguan Institute for Strategic Studies and Public Policy and the Dominican Republic Research Center for Women Action; and putting labor standards on the regional agenda. This project has taken advantage of the opening provided by CAFTA-DR and end-of-the Multi Fiber Agreement context to raise the issue of labor standards in a serious way with the key players, including the unions, the private sector, and the governments. The project has also: engaged over 400 stakeholders in the six countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic; obtained support from the free trade zone associations in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and from the association of maquilas in Honduras; collaborated with two U.S. Government initiatives working in the region, a U.S. Department of State-funded activity (the Central America Labor Assurance project) and a USAID-Women in Development office funded project, (Greater Access to Trade Expansion); and confirmed the addition of a new corporate multinational brand partner, the LimitedInc.  The project will receive cash resources to leverage from the LimitedInc.  As to Administrative Achievements, the alliance has: established a main office in Guatemala City; hired a Chief of Party, a Deputy Chief of Party, and a financial manager; developed Terms of Reference for, interviewed, and contracted consultants for performing diagnostics; developed web pages in English and Spanish (www.cimcaw.org); developed an intranet system for document storage with access by alliance partners; designed and printed updated project brochures in English and Spanish with objectives, activities and contact information; connected office to Internet and DAI network; and started negotiations with local partners in Nicaragua and Honduras to develop letters of agreement and sub contracts.</Description>

<Description>This Program provides Kenyan girls from disadvantaged backgrounds—many of them orphans—the skills, self-confidence, and support to escape the cycle of poverty themselves and in the next generation, as well.  This is achieved by providing them a dedicated mentor from Kenya or abroad – who provides continuous counsel throughout secondary and tertiary school; intensive workshops in life-skills—including financial literacy; a nine-month ICT course at an ICT Lab sponsored by Microsoft and other corporate partners; a college or university education; and workforce transitioning guidance.  In return, these girls agree to implement ‘Give Back’ projects in Nairobi or their local community/villages;  mentor the next generation of girls; and to ‘give back’ treasure too – once they realize financial independence.  Private sector partners also provide leadership training, funding for scholarships, internship opportunities, employee contribution matches, and staff to serve as mentors.</Description>

(2) Inform U.S. foreign assistance and diplomatic strategies based on major thematic areas and ideas that emerge across the span of the event. Global Pulse 2010 was a 3-day, online collaboration event that brought together individual socially engaged participants and organizations from around the world. As the name implies, the event took the pulse of thousands of participants on key issues facing communities around the world.  Participants chose from a list of 10 hot-button global issues facing the global community that interested them the most. Each issue had a number of recognized leaders in a related field of interest facilitating the  conversations. What is truly unique about Global Pulse 2010 is that it gave people working in the field who have innovative ideas, a chance to voice their opinion, learn from one another, and speak directly with those who have the desire and resources to take action.</Description>

<Description>The objective of the alliance with ESFE-AGAPE, is to train and certify at least 100 persons in Microsoft’s 5 Star .Net Certification.  This will potentially quadruple the number of 5 Star .Net certified professionals in the country. This partnership provides a 5 star .Net training that will allow trainees to be certified at progressively higher levels, from 1 star through 5 stars.    ESFE-AGAPE is a training center for vocational and technical training administered by an NGO. ESFE-AGAPE is responsible for designing a specialized training curriculum, identifying half of the potential participants, registering participants, and implementing the trainings.  There will be 3 successive groups of about 40 participants each; training for the 2nd and 3rd groups will be lead by the best students from the first groups after being trained to be trainers.  ESFE-AGAPE is contributing US$66,600 by paying for computer rentals, administrative costs, office expenses, and meals for participants.     EXOURCEGROUP is contributing US$35,374 by locating employment opportunities for trainees, matching trainees with employment vacancies, paying for educational counseling, and paying for per-diem and follow up costs.  EXSOURCEGROUP is also identifying about half of the participants from within its employees.  Also the salary costs of the EXSOURCEGROUP trainees, expected to be half the 50 to be certified, is paid by EXSOURCEGROUP.    The USAID Improving Access to Employment Program is responsible for ensuring that ESFE-AGAPE meets its proposed targets.  The Program contributed by paying for training and certification costs, computer rentals, and administrative costs.

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Crime Prevention for Vulnerable Youth</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>In 2004, USAID/Guatemala signed a Cooperative Agreement with Creative Associates Int&apos;l. Inc. to implement the &quot;Crime Prevention for Vulnerable Youth Alliance&quot; (CPVYA).  The original end date of the program was March 2006; however, USAID/Guatemala subsequently extended the agreement through October 31, 2007 and provided additional resources.  This Program is funded by the Global Development Alliance Secretariat ($300,000) and USAID/Guatemala ($1,301,020) for a total of $1,601,020.  This CPVYA (or PAJ as it is known locally) promotes public/private alliances to support crime prevention activities and helps create new jobs and training for vulnerable and at-risk youth.  The Program seeks to introduce corporate responsibility into mainstream business practices to engage the private sector in work related to youth at risk.  The Cooperative Agreement provides that partner organizations will leverage US$1,601,020.  During FY 2006, the Program trained 428 youths and placed 23 of them in jobs; it also managed to receive 88 voluntary trainers.  PAJ provided support to six community crime prevention councils or associations that sponsored activities to encourage youth to avoid gang membership and resolve conflict without violence.  It also established three outreach centers for youth at risk, where it continues to provide technical assistance.  The Program, with assistance from the Comite Coordinador de Asociaciones Agricolas, Comerciales, Industriales y Financieras (CACIF),  launched  Desafio 100 - Paz para Guatemala (Challenge 100-Peace for Guatemala).  CACIF actively worked with USAID and its members in the different business chambers to finalize the identification of 100 jobs for 100 former gang members under this Program.  Today there are 35 youths working in participant business.  The approach taken by USAID to link former gang members with respectable jobs is considered a unique and bold approach to obtain buy-in from both the private sector and the former gang members themselves.</Description>

<Description>Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Mineiro (SDM) and USAID met in June 2006 to discuss the possibility of establishing a partnership to address social development needs in the province of Lunda-Norte.  Together with the Government of Angola, SDM and USAID share the interest of reducing the levels of illicit operations that have led, in the past, to human rights abuses in the Cuango region; and of improving the living conditions of communities.  The partnership was created by USAID and SDM in June 2007, marking the beginning of a new public-private partnership, with ENDIAMA’s (the state owned diamond company that holds rights in all diamond activities in the country) tacit involvement.  This partnership seeks to exchange know-how and expertise that can help augment the capacity of private sector operators to improve social and economic development, governance, transparency and accountability in the region of Cuango, in Lunda-Norte.  A Diagnostic and Feasibility Assessment of the Cuango region for development and governance initiatives in Lunda Norte were conducted between October 2007 and February 2008.  The reports provided an overview of the development-enabling environment and of the existent social infrastructure.  These will be the basis for what may be a future GDA.</Description>

<Description>USAID partners with Vodafone Ghana, Ministry of Education/Ghana Education Service (MOE/GES) and the Global e-Schools Community Initiative (GeSCI) to provide internet access for 400 senior high schools to support ICT education and contribute towards wider community development.  The remaining high schools now have established internet services.  

Vodafone will provide either dedicated or wireless internet service.  Of the 400 high schools, 116 will receive a dedicated line and 284 will receive wireless service.  Vodafone agreed rates for 36 months will provide dedicated internet service at a cost of GHS 300.00 per month (excluding tax – GHS 366 with tax) per school that is internet enabled and wireless internet service at a token cost of GHS 30 per month (including tax).  These rates are significantly below Vodafone’s usual rates and represent part of Vodafone’s contribution to the GDA.  High schools will pay the recurrent internet costs from the current ICT fee that high schools charge students (which is set by GES at GHS 3 per term per student, though some schools charge more.), an arrangement confirmed with the high schools. 

USAID contributes direct financial support to GES to upgrade computer infrastructure in the 400 senior high schools to make them e-ready for wireless internet connectivity.  This will include providing each school with an internet server with links for existing school computers (thin client) and up to two personal computers.  The provision of internet servers with thin-client connections will enable GES to utilize existing computer equipment (such as monitors and keyboards) that do not require extensive upgrades to connect to the internet (as opposed to stand-alone desktop computers).  USAID will also provide the first month of internet service to enable testing of the system, with subsequent recurrent costs borne by GES and the high schools, though fees that are already collected for ICT purposes from students.  USAID&apos;s financial support to GES also includes technical assistance from GeSCI to develop the deployment strategy for internet connectivity and for support to GES to ensure transparent procurement of all services and equipment purchased with USAID funds.</Description>

<Description>&quot;The objective of the present grant is to help the establishment of a public-private partnership and structure the transaction for implementation of one wind power project in Bulgaria.  The objectives of the Alliance are to implement the first wind project of between 5 and 10 MW during the first 2 years of operation. 
EnCon Services International, in association with General Electric, the Utility Wind Interest Group, and USAID/Sofia has proposed to develop and operate a 5-10 MW pilot wind farm in partnership with a local government and local energy services company.  The proposed project structure involves an equipment finance lease for wind turbines and towers, and commercial debt financing from a local commercial bank for installation, balance of plant components and working capital for wind farm operation.  The proposed project structure requires the establishment of a public-private partnership with a private energy services company in Bulgaria that will be responsible for operation and maintenance of the wind farm, and a municipality which will use municipal assets to secure the finance lease and debt financing, both of which will be repaid from the project revenue stream via electricity sales to NEK, the National Electric Company in Bulgaria.

<Description>The Program Goal is the rejuvenation of a substantial section of the Downtown Kingston markets, thus creating a more economically viable, attractive, and accessible market and downtown area.. The market was severely damaged by firebombing during the intervention of the Jamaican Security forces to apprehend local gangster, &quot;Dudus,&quot; in May 2010. Digicel, a mobile phone company, already had a separate project working on the rejuvenation of the Downtown Kingston market.  USAID proposed a public-private partnership which would renovate another section of the market with Digicel focusing on the construction/infrastructure elements and USAID working on the soft side which includes economic opportunity for displaced vendors, anti-corruption, and Peace &amp; Security type activities.</Description>

<Description>1. Improve sustainable management of coastal economic resources in El Salvador.  2. Improve incomes of coastal community residents in El Salvador.  3. Improve environmental awareness among coastal community residents in El Salvador.  4. Improve sea turtle conservation in El Salvador. Coastal marine resources make an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy and are an important source of income for coastal residents. Because these resources are not well or sustainably managed, their contributions to the Salvadoran economy are at risk with impacts that fall heavily on the economically vulnerable coastal communities.     Since 2006, USAID/IMCCW has worked to improve Salvadoran natural resource management. In FY 2010 sea turtle conservation is one focus drawing attention to the broader need to improve coastal natural resource management and establish sustainable levels and methods of economic exploitation.    The state of sea turtles reflects the general state of Salvadoran coastal resources. Habitat degradation and unregulated, unsustainable collecting of the eggs of the four species of sea turtles nesting in El Salvador have brought a once abundant resource close to extinction with consequences that have affected thousands of families.    In February 2009 the Government of El Salvador banned any form of sea turtle commercialization. The economic impact would have fallen mostly on vulnerable tortugueros and their families. USAID/IMCCW and other organizations established a program that paid tortugueros to bring sea turtle eggs to beach hatcheries for protected incubation and release. This program succeeded in replacing lost tortugueros income, and released over 1 million sea turtle hatchlings. These activities continue in 2011 as part of a long-term, national program of sea turtle conservation.    The DISZASA Partnership will establish an alliance to support sea turtle hatchery operations on the Barra de Santiago beach in western El Salvador. The partnership will use seed funding and technical support from USAID/IMCCW to bring together Distribuidora Zablah and the Asociación Barra de Santiago tortuguero organization to continue sea turtle egg collection activities and hatchery operations for at least five years.</Description>

<Description>Tolo TV’s Dream and Achieve show (2006-2012), a USAID partnership with ToloTV, the American University in Afghanistan, and the Export Promotion Agency of Afghanistan (EPAA), followed six finalists over thirteen episodes as competitors demonstrated their socially responsible and sustainable business concepts to a panel of expert judges. The program helped entrepreneurs improve their businesses while educating viewers about the importance of the private sector. Viewers also learned practical business skills and basic competitive strategy while supporting their favorite entrepreneurs. Nearing the show’s end, USAID linked the top contestants to business support organizations to strengthen their business models and chances to win. In the first season, the top five contestants included two women, as well as an ex-warlord who had disarmed to start a dairy business. The owner of a plastic recycling plant in Kandahar won the $20,000 grand-prize, which he used to expand his plant capacity to use renewable micro-hydropower. Total project investment reached about $400,000.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>DREAM Project (Dominican Republic Education and Mentoring)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>On April 24, 2008, USAID entered into a two-year Cooperative Agreement with the DREAM Project in Cabarete, Puerto Plata.  The Project focus is to develop and implement quality academic tutoring programs that target 250 at-risk youths.  There are two summer school and camp programs: one for 10-12 year olds and another for 13-18 year olds.  The children are divided into age-appropriate groups and assigned counselors to maintain a 4:1 student to teacher ratio (compared to the Cabarete’s public school norm of 46:1).  Camp is held from 9 am to 3 pm Monday through Friday.  During these hours, campers rotate between five 50-minute periods of instruction in one of six subjects – Academic Tutoring, Arts and Crafts, Music and Dance, Sports and Recreation, Science and Nature, and Life Skills.  The project incorporates student-centered, project-based curriculum learning.  Youths are able to explore and benefit from the surrounding natural environment.  Students learn about Dominican art history and anthropology at the Centro de Leon Museum in Santiago; receive swimming lessons and water safety instructions at water parks; observe marine life at Ocean World in Puerto Plata; paint their own canvases at the Motif Art Gallery in Sosua; learn about airplanes at the Puerto Plata airport; tour the Jewish Heritage Museum in Sosua; experience another way of life at a Haitian Batey (sugar cane field) in Caraballo; and listen to a critical tale from their own history on the Mirabal Tour in Salcedo.  The field trips are supported by local businesses that are now partners with the DREAM Project.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Eco-Housing in India (IIEC)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Buildings have a significant impact on resource use and the environment during their life cycle. Conventional buildings are highly resource intensive, during both construction as well as operation and maintenance. The term &quot;Eco-housing&quot; stands for environmentally benign, energy efficient building; sustainable construction practices; and a healthy and productive indoor environment, with lowered use of natural resources. Eco-housing assumes significance because it effectively addresses issues related to sustainable development, energy efficiency and resource conservation. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Eco-housing Mainstreaming Partnership in collaboration with the International Institute of Energy Conservation (IIEC) with the objective of institutionalizing sustainable Eco-housing practices in the country. The primary goal of this partnership is to initiate a market development process for Eco-housing in India in order to bring together the supply and demand sides of Eco-housing. The program was piloted in Pune in partnership with various stakeholders, including the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), leading architects and developers, educational institutions, and technology providers. In phase II, the establishment of a Sustainable &apos;Building Technology Centre&apos; (SBTC) marks the visible culmination of efforts to promote ecologically sound building construction in otherwise sprawling and rapidly growing urban sprawls in India. There is huge potential of energy savings by building sector and the Sustainable Building Technology Center’s (SBTC) will serve as the Institutional home for the long term capacity building and technology promotion leading to mainstreaming Eco-housing in India. It will result in a self-sustainable business model consisting of technology demonstrations, building technology related training program and certification program and provide a long term institutional home to the efforts in the sector thus far.</Description>

<Description>The alliance supports national efforts to reduce disparities created by apartheid in the quality of education in historically privileged and disadvantaged areas by providing computer laboratories, Microsoft software, digital satellite decoders, and training to principals and teachers in these areas.  USAID’s contribution to the collaborative effort was a series of 12 week training programs over a three-year period for math, science and technology teachers through a U.S. community college consortium.  A group of 39 math and science teachers (28M/11F) completed the U.S. training in FY 2005, bringing the total number of South Africans trained as part of this program to 134 (91M/43F).  The South African Department of Education reported that student participation and success rates increased in math and science subjects.  The total number of students who passed math at the end of 2004 had increased by 36% (from 3,485 to 4,746 students) and by 38% in physical science (from 2,724 to 3,766 students).</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Education Quality and Access for Learning and Livelihood Skills (EQuALLS)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Assistance for the Comprehensive Educational Development of Mindanao (ASCEND Mindanao) Alliance seeks to increase learning opportunities for basic and non-formal education for children and adolescents in the poorest, school-less and conflict-affected communities of Maguindanao, Sulu, North Cotabato, and Zamboanga del Sur.
 
Education and Livelihood Skills Alliance (ELSA): ELSA seeks to build multi-stakeholder and multi-sector partnerships in Mindanao, while leveraging existing programs and partnerships to improve educational quality, increase employment opportunities, and engage young Filipino leaders.  In addition, the alliance will establish alternative learning systems for young people in Mindanao, particularly in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which does not have access to formal school due to poverty, armed conflict or simply because of limited or absence of formal education structures in its communities. 

Another goal is improvement in teaching and learning English in Mindanao, via educational radio, audio, print, and integrated training.  The DIWA alliance addresses the problem of very poor reading and number skills of children in grades 1-3 in seven municipalities and one city in ARMM.  The program will enable all primary school children in the target areas to read and understand simple English and do Mathematics well by the time they leave grade 3. 

Television Education for the Advancement of Muslim Mindanao (TEAM Mindanao) addresses the need for a strategic and innovative intervention in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).  It also responds to the need to provide business and skills training for out-of-school youth through the continued airing of program modules on livelihood and business skills directed at them. 

A final goal is to provide new books for the southern island of Mindanao, with specific focus on responding to the needs of the people in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao.  The books will primarily focus on elementary education, especially English, Math and Science for Grades 1-3.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Education Quality and Access for Learning and Livelihood Skills 2 (EQuALLS -2)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The primary purpose of the) Project is to improve quality and access to basic education in areas most affected by poverty and conflict in the Philippines, specifically the ARMM and Regions 9 and 12 in Mindanao, and to provide alternative learning opportunities, including livelihood training, to out-of-school youth in these regions. The primary focus of efforts to improve both the quality of and access to basic education is on grades 1-3. Poor teaching and learning in grades 1-3, overcrowded classes, and lack of access to schools or effective alternative learning opportunities present barriers to students&apos; ability to learn. Some activities may address math, science, and English at other grade levels, but the academic focus remains primarily at the elementary level, up to grade 6.  EQuALLS2 also supports programs that reintegrate out-of-school youth into the peaceful, productive economy.  A team of local and international organizations with expertise in education and youth development, led by the Education Development Center, implements EQuALLS2.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Elizabeth Glaser Call to Action Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Program for Malawi</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The goal is to reduce maternal and child mortality. It is estimated that more than 1,000 new pediatric HIV infections will be averted in FY09, as more than 52,000 pregnant women receive HIV testing and more than 6,600 HIV-positive pregnant women receive ARV prophylaxis. Many maternal lives will also be saved through the enrollment of more than 1,300 HIV - positive women on antiretroviral treatment. The long-term goal is to strengthen the capacity of the national health systems. In FY09 USAID funds, complimented by private EGPAF funds, will continue to support EGPAF and expand and strengthen PMTCT services in Malawi, as per the goals and objectives listed above. With the Ministry of Health (MOH) continuing its nationwide scale-up of PMTCT services in Malawi, EGPAF will provide technical assistance to the MOH through a two prolonged approach. First, EGPAF will continue their successful partnership with the University of North Carolina, training MOH nurses in PMTCT delivery and providing technical assistance to an expanding number of PMTCT sites througout Lilongwe District. The second approach focusses on the placement of EGPAF technical staff in Malawi to provide direct support to the MOH, including capacity assessments of Malawi&apos;s 28 districts, and providing clinical and technical mentoring to district health offices and PMTCT providers nationwide. Program priorities are focussed on improving the qualiy of PMTCT services and bringing PMTCT and care and treatment programs together to actively enroll HIV-positive mothers and their exposed infants into HIV care and treatment.    The program primarily works in collaboration with the University of North Carolina with and the MOH through the Lilongwe District Health Office. Additional program partners include UNICEF, the Baylor Center of Excellence, BASICS/Management Sciences for Health (MSH), and PACT, all of whom are members of the Malawi PMTCT Technical Working Group. These partners work to ensure complementary services and geographic coverage, avoiding overlap and duplication of services. UNICEF provides technical assistance to the entire PMTCT national program. BASICS/MSH focuses on child survival programs linked to PMTCT services, and has entered into an agreement with EGPAF-UNC Program to use the four EGPAF-UNC implementation sites as practical PMTCT training sites. EGPAF-UNC works with the Baylor early infant diagnosis program in the four implementing sites to refer all HIV - exposed infants to ensure a continuum of care.    EGPAF and UNC have been providing support for PMTCT in Malawi since 2001 through private funding. Central funding from USAID/Washington complimented the private funding and enabled the program to expand beginning in December, 2005. With FY07 funding USAID/Malawi began to provide bilateral support to the program to complement the EGPAF private funding.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Employee and Community Health Clinics under Smiling Sun Franchise Program (SSFP)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The partnership between USAID and Chevron provides essential health services such as family planning, child health, and maternal health to over 400,000 people who previously had no access to quality health services.  The beneficiaries are marginalized rural poor, many from minority ethnic groups, who work as farmers or laborers in the Chevron natural gas field in Bibiyana.  The communities come from Inathganj and Dighalbak Union of Nabiganj in Habiganj district.  Chevron supported the construction of three SSFP clinics and continues to support staffing, service expansion for operation theater, laboratory services, delivery services, ambulance and other operational costs of the three clinics. USAID funding supports supervision and oversight of clinic performance.
The partnership between USAID and British American Tobacco Bangladesh (BATB) contributes to a similar goal of granting and expanding access to basic health services for people who either lack or have limited access to quality health care services.  Therefore, under this partnership, BATB grants 2500 of its employees and their families access to basic and quality health care service by purchasing Health Benefit Cards that their workers can use at USAID supported health clinics under the Smiling Sun Franchise Program (SSFP).</Description>

<Description>The objective of the alliance is to train and place at least 40 people with disabilities in jobs in the finance sector.  FUNTER is responsible for conducting two training courses, each for 20 people with disabilities.  The partnership also includes the building of alliances with potential employers, such as CitiBank.

FUNTER is responsible for designing the training courses, working with employers such as CitiBank to identify potential candidates for training, select a group of 40 individuals who have the potential to acquire the necessary work skills, helping trainees find employment opportunities, and promoting the program so more companies like CitiBank become involved and understand how to work with those with disabilities.  FUNTER is contributing US$40,660 to this project by paying for training staff, computers, and other services.    CitiBank was the first company to participate in this program and work closely with FUNTER to employ disabled individuals.  CitiBank provided US$18,000 by paying for a portion of the training costs, equipment and tests.    The USAID Improving Access to Employment Program is overseeing this project and ensuring that FUNTER is carrying out the project in a way that the target number of 40 trainees is reached.  The Program is contributing US$43,339 to the project by paying for a portion of training costs and paying the majority of the participants’ per diem.

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Enhancing Public-Private Sector Partnership in TB Prevention and Control:  The Workplace TB Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) Program</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The development of TB DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) program in the workplace is seen to harness private sector resources in expanding the provision of quality TB services. The workplace is seen as a potential market for DOTS since majority of TB cases are in the working age group. The partnership aims to help companies set up TB control and prevention program following the DOTS strategy as an integral part of the organization’s occupational safety and health program. The workplace TB partnership among the Department of Health Center for Health Development (CHDs or DOH regional offices), local government units (LGUs), the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the private companies benefits employees and their dependents, contractors and the businesses’ immediate communities. Pilot efforts showed increased TB detection rate, cure rate, de-stigmatization of TB in the workplace and the community, increased awareness of DOTS, and the promotion of public and private partnership through formal linkages between the workplace and the RHUs. USAID’s Linking Initiatives and Networking to Control Tuberculosis or TBLINC project in close coordination with PBSP (Philippines Business and Social Progress) assists the companies: Develop policies consistent with the DOLE  guidelines on TB control and prevention in the workplace, Employee-employer education to increase the awareness on TB and eliminate stigma, Re-orientation from dependence on x-ray in TB diagnosis to sputum exam which is the golden standard for diagnosis, Training of company health staff on TB management and education, Linking private companies with public health centers and DOTS accredited diagnostic facilities through referrals. The workplace TB program framework developed by PBSP integrates the essential components of DOTS and the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The strategy involves DOH-CHDs,  the provincial, city and municipal health officers and DOLE. This includes clarification of stakeholder roles, advocacy, training, service delivery, monitoring and supervision. Requisite is capacity-building involving training workplace clinic staff, along with partner RHUs, to ensure understanding of the DOTS principles and processes. Trainees are oriented on use of various forms including referral, quarterly report , TB registry and symptomatic forms. A separate training on program management  involving management committee members and essential staff is aimed in drafting respective company’s TB policy and program guidelines. This participative exercise increased number of enhanced TB policies and more structured referrals.</Description>

<Description>The Alliance for Support of Women in Business in Astana (Alliance) was initiated in September 2005 under a Global Development Alliance (GDA) between the ExxonMobil Foundation (ExxonMobil), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Kazakhstan Loan Fund (KLF) with the objective of improving social and economic conditions.  USAID’s contribution was $500,000 and ExxonMobil’s $600,000.  ExxonMobil funding is provided through the ExxonMobil Foundation Educating Women &amp; Girls Initiative.  The Alliance has brought strategic consulting services and training in the areas of strategic business planning, financial management, marketing, and human resource management to entrepreneurs, small and medium-size business owners, and managers in Astana, with a particular focus on women.   
Based on the strong performance and progress shown by local training service providers, in late 2007 the ExxonMobil Foundation made a decision to provide direct funding to two local organizations: the Small and Medium Business/Entrepreneurship Development Federation (SME Federation) and Turan-,Profi International Professional Academy (Turan-Profi) for the delivery of training services.  ExxonMobil’s contribution for 2008 is $321,000.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Establishment of a Commercial Leasing Company in Armenia</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>ACBA Leasing Co., SA, was launched on April 25th, 2003.  ACBA Leasing was the first privately financed commercial leasing company in Armenia.  Its activities focused on the provision of capital equipment to agribusiness enterprises and other private businesses in Armenia on a financial lease basis.  The financing option provided by ACBA Leasing responded to the general lack of reasonably priced medium term credit funds and the shortage of collateral that significantly limited the borrowing capacity of most small and medium enterprises in Armenia. 
The company was capitalized with a total of $5,200,000 including equity capital and credit lines provided by Armenian and international investors totaling $4,000,000 and grant support of $1,200,000 from USAID.  Technical support for the development of ACBA Leasing Company was provided by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) under auspices of USAID/Armenia’s “Armenia Agribusiness SME Market Development Project”.  The largest, though still less than majority shareholder in the new company is ACBA Bank.

Last year, USAID, through UNICEF, provided 50% of routine vaccines while 50% was provided by the Government of Georgia, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization - GAVI/VF, and the private foundation -  Vishnevskaya-Rostropovich Foundation.  This year USAID will phase out of this activity.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Expansion of Municipal Development through Infrastructure Financing</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objective of this alliance is to expand opportunities for Mexican states and municipalities to access private sector financing for infrastructure projects through the Mexican capital markets. USAID and its Global Development Alliance partner, the Minneapolis-based financial advisory  firm Evensen Dodge International, are introducing new financial structures and practices to  Mexico to enable sub-national governments to access Mexico’s capital market and lower the  cost of borrowing.    The specific objectives of the Sub-National Government  Finance Program are to:  • Mobilize domestic credit for basic infrastructure projects  that benefit Mexican citizens and improve conditions for  economic growth,  • Lower costs of borrowing, including bond issuance, and  encourage more states and municipalities to seek capital  market financing,  • Help states and municipalities engage directly with  private investors through the market, and  • Provide incentives for sub-national governments to  improve financial management and reporting practices.  A lack of modern infrastructure impedes Mexico’s competitiveness.  One of the principal obstacles to improving Mexican infrastructure  has been the lack of access to market-based, long-term financing.    Until 2002, Mexican states and municipalities relied solely on  financing provided through the Mexican federal government and  short-term commercial bank loans, as investor wariness and  excessive transaction costs discouraged sub-national governments  from bond issuances.    Rating agencies note that most Mexican states are underleveraged and retain significant debt capacity. A  conservative estimate of the potential for the Mexican state and municipal bond market is US$4-6 billion  annual volume.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Feed the Future: Increasing and diversifying chickpea yields</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>To strengthen key food commodity value chains in priority African countries in alignment with the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative (FTF). Under this partnership, we have developed the first set of goals and objectives to be operationalized in Ethiopia addressing the chickpea agriculture value chain.  Ethiopia is Africa’s largest producer of chickpeas, but there remains high potential to increase yields and improve quality for export and develop local processing capacity for the domestic market.  In support of the country’s agriculture sector development plans, and with financial and technical support from USAID, PepsiCo will launch an agricultural pilot in 2011, focused on optimizing chickpea production through technology and quality control, supporting local business development among millers, processors and packers, and applying capacity-building best practices.    The 2011 pilot will aim to place 1-3 hectares of farmland under chickpea cultivation  The objective of the pilot will be to understand growing characteristics of chickpea varieties of commercial importance to PepsiCo, as well as of relevance to the World Food Programme&apos;s chickpea-based supplementary feeding product.  Specifically, the pilot will aim to identify optimal agronomic practices for these chickpea varieties in Ethiopia.  The ultimate aim will be to improve crop yields and quality.  PepsiCo has identified a commercial farm partner in Amhara and will initiate negotiation to develop a contract for the use of upto 3 ha of commercial farmland.  Pilot design will be conducted with the farmer, together with experts from PepsiCo and USAID.   PepsiCo will obtain specifications for seed varieties and characteristics from the company&apos;s global businesses that currently use and procure chickpeas   The identified farmland is adjacent to smallholder plots. As part of the pilot design, these smallholders may be approached for engagement in pilot activities for training and technology transfer, such as establishment and maintenance of drip irrigation systems.   The pilot design will be completed in time for the conventional chickpea growing season which starts in October 2011</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Finca and Visa International</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>FINCA International and Visa International envision utilizing world-class payment technologies to increase the efficiency of microfinance and provide cutting-edge customer-focused new products, such as pre-paid cards, and remittance delivery, which will lend to expanding access to microfinance and basic banking services to the world&apos;s poor.  The alliance brings to bear Visa’s significant experience and market resources on the problem of technological modernization of micro-finance.  The poor will have greater access to micro-finance at a lower cost, and the opportunity costs of borrowing will be lower with a lower transaction cost.  The general aim of the project is to pilot-test innovative solutions in FINCA affiliates, using electronic payment platforms as a means to lower costs and improve services to clients.  The project supports activities in two pilot countries: Guatemala and Nicaragua.  There have been significant results achieved in bank partnership development.  During this period FINCA Guatemala&apos;s banking partner, BANCAFE, was liquidated in October 2006, forcing FINCA Guatemala to suspend its operations on this project.  Most of FINCA&apos;s assets in BANCAFE have now been transferred to the Rural Development Bank (BANRURAL).  The co-branded debit cards were rendered null and void from the date that BANCAFE was closed.  FINCA is currently in the process of stabilizing its normal operations for loan disbursement and collection by strengthening its relationship with BANRURAL.  FINCA will assess the possibility of re-launching the savings and debit card product through cooperation with another bank, and will begin a round of discussions with potential bank partners.  In consideration of this development, the agreement with FINCA/VISA will be extended through September 28, 2007.  In Nicaragua, the project has also been delayed due to issues with the banking partner, Bancentro.  In June 2006, FINCA&apos;s negotiating counterparts at Bancentro were replaced and the incoming managers required that the deal be re-negotiated.  FINCA has recently received updated pricing from Bancentro and expects to finalize the contract soon.  FINCA and the bank will also need to establish their back-office connectivity and develop the materials necessary to support the sale and delivery of the product, such as client contracts, training materals, etc.  These activities had already commenced and the order for cards was placed.  FINCA anticipates that the first cards will be ready for pilot-testing with clients in October 2007, which is after the closing date of this project.  In the meantime, FINCA will complete the intermediate steps outlined in the implementation plan, like preparation for re-launching and re-launching.  The services will be delivered via a single instrument, a co-branded debit-remittance cards.  Services will include: savings accounts, ATM access, providing safer access to funds, purchases at merchants accepting Visa and remittance access.  The FINCA card and savings accounts will be linked to an electronic channel for remittances from the United States. Clients will be able to call the bank and have their electronic remittances transferred directly to their account without the normal visit and wait at the bank or remittance agency.  Clients will then have direct access to remittances via ATM or at merchants accepting Visa.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Fishing with 3G Nets</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Fishing with 3G Nets created a system to foster sustainable economic development and increase public safety by promoting digital and social inclusion for isolated fisherman and oyster’s cultivators. The system integrates mobile and web-based applications and tablet devices to support business operations and deliver real-time safety information to participating community members in Santa Cruz Cabrália, Bahia, Brazil. Qualcomm’s 3G wireless technology serves as the catalyst to link the beneficiaries with access to information, social networks, and markets.

Results:
Income generation – Until august 2013, 22 tons of fish were caught, processed and commercialized, which generated U$97,000 in new income to fishermen and their families. Fishermen from the indigenous people of Pataxos are also beneficiaries of the project.

Cultivation of oyster to benefit local women - An oyster farm was established to create job for local women. In 2012, more than 10.000 oysters were treated and 4.120 were sold in the market generating U$ 2,574 in revenues. 42 local restaurants and hotels are purchasing oysters using project’s web based and mobile equipment to order and communicate with the local women. 3 large aquariums were installed in selected restaurants to showcase the project and sell the oysters. The income generated go straight to the group of 30 local women participants in the project.

Internet Access - New telecommunication tower was installed in the community of Guaiu providing to approximately 12.000 residents access to internet and cellular phone system.

Replicating Fishing with 3G Nets project in Colombia – Because of the successful implementation and results, Qualcomm has consulted with USAID/Brazil on how to expand the project to Colombia.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Frotan Auto Gas</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The purpose of this GDA is to expand the operations of Frotan Auto Gas into the important population center of Jalalabad, Nangarhar. Frotan Auto Gas was established in 2008 in Kabul and Mazar e Sharif to convert automobiles to use Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and then provide fuel at several fueling stations. Since its establishment, Frotan Auto Gas has converted approximately 800 vehicles. This expansion into Nangarhar is an essential next step in expanding this business nationwide. Nangarhar is one of the most highly populated provinces and an important transit route for vehicles. There are approximately 4,000 auto rickshaws in the city and around 3,000 vehicles travelling daily in the highway from Torkham border of Pakistan to Kabul the capital.  Transport is one of the most essential sectors for economic growth. This project contributes to economic growth by connecting Afghans to a cheaper and more efficient energy infrastructure. The conversion workshop and filling stations will spur private sector growth by creating skilled jobs and lowering the costs of local transportation. Additionally, it will transfer LPG technology to the Eastern Region of Afghanistan, laying the foundation for future expansion of LPG as an alternative fuel source. The conversion of vehicles to use LPG fuel will also benefit the environment of Afghanistan. As LPG CO2 emissions are significantly less than that of petroleum based fuel.   ASMED will support Frotan Auto Gas in achieving these objectives by providing funding for the following items: · Conversion workshop tools and equipment · LPG storage cylinders for fuel station · Marketing expenses for promoting use of LPG as an alternative fuel source  This financial support will enable Frotan Auto Gas to establish a conversion workshop and two pilot fueling stations in and around Jalalabad City, and encourage local vehicle owners to convert their vehicles. Once a customer base has been established, Frotan Auto Gas plans to bring an additional two filling stations to the area.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Fund for Belarus Democracy</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objectives of this alliance are twofold: direct grants to civic initiatives and organizations in Belarus to enable civil society to withstand the pressures of a dictatorial regime and to work towards its democratization; and building stronger links between Belarusian NGOs, civic leaders, and citizens, and their counterparts in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which will provide for an international exchange of information, skills, best practices, and resources to advance civil society and democracy in Belarus.   
As of FY06, the results show that the FBD has disbursed 63 grants totaling $809,396.  Over four-fifths of this funding was received by recipients in Belarus and supported the strengthening of civic infrastructures, voter information and education, monitoring of social and political developments, and citizen mobilization.  The remaining funding went toward building contacts and partnerships between Belarusian citizens and organizations, and their counterparts in neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  In addition to direct grant making, FBD has leveraged co-funding from a variety of European and American donors.  This assistance was an important source of support for Belarusian Civil society.  The funding helped fulfill the stated objectives in the following ways:  Resources assisted civic leaders, initiatives and organizations to face the simultaneous challenges of having to sustain their resistance to repressive measures by the state authorities.  They carried out activities informing and educating citizens of their human, civic, and political rights which had been blatantly violated by the current Government of Belarus.  In addition, Belarusian civil society was increasingly linked to civil society from neighboring countries and thus gained much from the experience, understanding, resources, and contacts their counterparts in neighboring countries have developed in going through wrenching political change, in particular when it comes to the active role of civil society for democracy.  Building cross-border relationships, joint projects, and exchange of experience and information with other post-communist countries in the region was of considerable importance for energizing democracy and civil society tin Belarus.</Description>

<Description>The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator in the U.S. Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development and General Mills seek to share their respective strengths, methodologies, and resources to pursue a Public Private Partnership focused on improving the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in the food sector across sub-Saharan Africa to produce healthy, fortified food products, while increasing and improving markets for smallholder farmers in the region. Systemic and chronic food insecurity has long plagued many parts of the world most severely affected by HIV/AIDS, and there is a complex relationship between the two conditions.  PEPFAR integrates specific and targeted nutrition interventions with HIV/AIDS treatment and care programs in an effort to improve clinical outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). PEPFAR food and nutritional support is currently directed to orphans and vulnerable children born to an HIV-infected parent, regardless of the child’s HIV or nutritional status, HIV-positive pregnant and lactating women in programs to prevent the transmission of HIV to their children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding to patients in ART and care programs who have evidence of clinical malnutrition, as defined by the World Health Organization (Body Mass Index less than 18.5). Nutritional support includes therapeutic foods for the management of severe malnutrition, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), supplementary foods for mild-to-moderately malnourished patients (Body Mass Index 16-18.5), such as fortified, blended flours that can be reconstituted with water as porridge, and supplemental foods for nutritionally vulnerable individuals, particularly women in PMTCT programs and their infants up to 24 mo of age, which could be ready-to-use foods (RUFs) or fortified, blended flour.   A key component of USAID’s rural development strategy is to link small farmers to markets to increase family income and food security. USAID promotes food security by stimulating rural economies through broad-based agricultural growth, which increases incomes along with food production, reduces poverty, and brings down food prices in local markets for the urban poor.  USAID’s approach takes several forms, including providing immediate and expanded humanitarian responses to crises, investing in staple food production and value transformation through increased food processing capabilities for local residents, promoting trade liberalization to reduce price volatility, supporting an enabling environment for agribusiness investment and market expansion, and increasing availability and use of advanced agricultural technologies.  It is especially in this last intervention that USAID seeks to engage private food companies in advancing the food security of vulnerable populations.</Description>

<Description>This alliance with the African Agricultural Technology Foundation will enhance the livelihoods of the people of West Africa by making available improved and more productive cowpea varieties that are resistant to infestation by insects.  Cowpea is the most important food grain legume in the dry savannas of tropical Africa, providing cash income as well as a nutritious protein supplement.  This activity will directly benefit women, who form the majority of the cowpea growers.  Because of its high nutritional value and protein content, the increased production of cowpea will also have a positive impact on those afflicted with HIV/AIDS by making it more readily available.  It is estimated that 90% of this benefit will occur in Nigeria because it is the largest cowpea producer in Africa.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Georgia Business Climate Reform Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Business Climate Reform Alliance (2005-2009), a USAID partnership with the Georgian government and the American Chamber of Commerce, worked to improve public management and streamline services for businesses and the public, including simplifying administrative procedures. The partnership also engaged the Georgian government to improve tax and customs administration and assist in the analysis, drafting, amendment, and implementation of commercial laws and improved business regulations. The Georgian government passed reforms that resulted in an estimated $743.7 million in annual monetized benefits to the public and private sectors — a return of $57 for every dollar spent on the project. From 2005 to 2008, there was a 121% increase in the number of registered taxpayers, a 97% increase in total tax revenues, and a 5% increase of foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP. From 2005 to 2009, there was a 67% increase in businesses registered. These results, as well as the project’s methodology for quantifying the economic benefits of the reforms, helped generate political involvement and identify long-term government priorities. Total project investment reached $12.9 million.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Georgian Bankers Association – Caucasus School of Business</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The primary objective of the Georgian Bank Training Center (GBTC) is to address the needs of the Georgian banking sector and provide training programs for professional bankers that will meet international standards and certification requirements.  Designed primarily for commercial banks, GBTC is also open to all financial companies, including microfinance institutions, the National Bank of Georgia, insurance companies, leasing companies, pension funds, the securities industry, and individuals that are seeking a career in finance.  USAID-funded SME Support Project partnered with the Association of Banks of Georgia (ABG) by providing technical assistance and a non-competitive grant to ABG in the amount of approximately $87,500 to develop the (GBTC).  This grant was matched by the contributions of the commercial banks, all members of the ABG.  The ABG, in turn, announced a tender for selecting the business school that, in conjunction with the ABG, would oversee the training courses, including timing, content of curricula, pricing, etc.  As a result of the tender, the Caucasus University (CU), one of the leading business schools in Georgia, was selected to house, manage, and support the GBTC.  The CU in turn donated the exclusive use of a building and staff for the GBTC.  A limited liability company was established to operate the GBTC that is 51% owned by the ABG and 49% by the CU; with all profits to be used for the further development of the GBTC.  A supervisory board of the GBTC was formed from the members of the banking community, National Bank of Georgia and other interested parties.  The Hellenic Bankers Association and their training arm, the Hellenic Banking Institute, provided technical assistance and licensed training material for the newly-established GBTC.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is a public-private initiative to save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat climate change by creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient household cooking solutions.  The World Health Organization estimates that human exposure to harmful cookstove smoke is one of the top five health risks in poor, developing countries.  The Alliance aims for 100 million homes to adopt clean and efficient stoves and fuels by 2020. Exposure to smoke from traditional cookstoves and open fires—the primary means of cooking and heating for nearly three billion people in the developing world—causes 1.9 million premature deaths annually, with women and young children the most affected.  Reliance on biomass for home cooking also forces women and children to spend many back-breaking hours each week collecting fuel -- often leaving them vulnerable to personal attack.  Inefficient cookstoves also increases pressures on local natural resources and contribute to climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols.    The Alliance represents the first time that leading donors and the private, public, philanthropic, and academic leaders of this sectors have joined forces to develop a common strategy to achieve global scale results for this field.  Several factors are aligning to put the sector within reach of a “tipping point” for adopting clean cookstoves at scale, including:  recent advances in clean cookstove design, testing, and monitoring; compelling new research on the health and environmental benefits of use of clean and efficient cooking stoves and fuels; recent succes and growth of several business models in this field; the advent of national cookstove programs in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin Americal; and the potential for carbon finance to fund stove initiatives at greater scale.  The Alliance will work in cooperation with other leading non-profit organizations, foundations, academic institutions, corporate leaders, governments, and UN agencies to help overcome the market barriers that currently impede the production, deployment, and use of clean cookstoves in the developing world.    The Alliance aims to create a thriving global market based on high-quality, proven products – both stoves and fuels.  To meet and sustain a global scale of production and distribution to the full target market will eventually require a fully commercial platform.  As this industry develops over the coming years, commercial solutions will be a critical, but by no means the only, dissemination model of Alliance partners.  Well-designed government efforts have demonstrated an ability to reach large populations and are critical components to reach the very poor in particular.  Likewise, humanitarian settings offer a special case where purely commercial solutions are not always realistic.  The Alliance will work with partners reach all of these affected populations.</Description>

This alliance will increase access to education by allowing educators to teach at night and will enhance the educational experience, since students will no longer be required to huddle around a shared book by lamp or candle light at night.  This will promote community-based learning activities for children and adults, and has applicability to all community educational activities, including agriculture, health and environment.  The project also has commercial applications as well, through the transfer of the technology for possible manufacture in Mali.  Adult literacy has demonstrated a positive impact on children’s education as well, so this project would indirectly benefit the children of literate parents.</Description>

<Description>The goal of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (&quot;TB Alliance&quot;) is to develop better, faster-acting and more affordable medicines that will shorten the duration of TB treatment or otherwise simplify its completion; be effective against MDR-TB; and improve the treatment of latent TB infection.  The principal benefit of a faster and simpler therapy would be the ability of healthcare workers to reach and treat more TB patients, thus expanding DOTS and helping achieve the global Stop TB targets.  Over the past 4 years the TB Alliance has established the first, most comprehensive portfolio of potential TB drugs since the 1960s.  The current portfolio consists of new compounds as well as next generation analogs of current antibiotics.  Additionally, these investments have helped reinvigorate the field of TB drug development and enlisted new players.  Currently the TB Alliance is working with FDA to prepare the compound PA-824 for Phase 1 trials.</Description>

<Description>Encourage Healthy Russian Communities includes a number of activities in selected pilot regions under the concept of &quot;healthy communities.&quot;  The plan is that after activities in pilot regions start showing results, the alliance will replicate developed models and approaches in other regions where Wimm-Bill-Dann (WBD, a Russian juice packaging firm) has a significant strategic interest.  Components will help develop professional agro-production skills; promote healthy life-styles among the targeted groups of population (primarily youth); encourage best practices in the area of social protection of the general population and specifically children and orphans; support energy efficiency in local communities and environmentally-based initiatives at the community level such as sustainable water consumption, solid municipal waste collection and disposal, and environmental clean up; and increase civic activism to promote environment-friendly practices and public participation in environmental decision-making.  In addition, this activity will contribute to civic education through such activities as the Junior Achievement Program, which will offer training and practice in economics and applied business, thus supporting the growth of small businesses and integrating youth after graduation into business activities.  Specific themes under the Junior Achievement Program will be selected and adapted to build on the strengths, opportunities and specifics of each region.</Description>

<Description>Objectives:    Recognize and celebrate the contribution of diaspora communities to America’s relationship with their countries of origin or ancestry.   Foster diaspora-centric partnership models.   Encourage intra-diaspora collaboration and learning. Over 500 diaspora leaders from all over the country with roots in countries all over the world attended the “historic” and “unparalleled” Secretary’s Global Diaspora Forum (quotes from participant feedback forms). The forum was also supported by USAID, the Migration Policy Institute, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.  The Secretary officially launched the International Diaspora Engagement Alliance, or IDEA—the major deliverable of the Forum. The ten founding partners of this public-private platform respectively announced their commitment to IDEA. The partners include: The International Fund for Agricultural Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank’s Africa Programme, Western Union, the HAND Foundation, m-via, Digicel, the U.S.-Mexico Foundation, PhilDev, and the U.S. Department of State’s Global Partnership Initiative (S/GPI). IDEA will be incubated in its first year at the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).  Principals who spoke included Secretary Clinton, USAID Administrator Raj Shah, Under Secretary Maria Otero, Under Secretary Judith McHale, Assistant Secretary Jose Fernandez, Assistant Secretary Eric Schwartz, MCC Chairman and CEO Daniel Yohannes, and other principals from across the USG  Substantive panel discussions featured leaders from diaspora communities discussing innovations and best practices in the fields of: health and medicine, innovation, science and technology, entrepreneurship, philanthropy, investment and trade, volunteerism, agriculture and rural development, disaster and humanitarian relief, education, remittances, ethnic media, youth, and sports.  The events were livestreamed around the country and around the world, with login points from over 24 countries. A number of countries hosted viewing parties, and participants were invited to join a live webchat.  On May 19th, a dozen partner organizations around DC hosted “un-conference” events related to the themes of the conference. Such organizations included The U.S. Institute for Peace, the World Bank, the Hudson Institute, and many others. That afternoon, delegates re-convened at the Ronald Reagan building for a structured networking session hosted by USAID. This event, titled “Building Partnerships with the U.S. Government and Beyond” featured roundtables hosted by a variety of U.S. government agencies and offices, as well as keynote remarks by Under Secretary Judith McHale, Assistant Secretary Eric Schwartz, and Deputy Administrator Don Steinberg.</Description>

<Description>Through this alliance, farmers will work under environmental and labor standards. They will also comply with quality, prices and food safety provisions to obtain an independent certification recognized by the United States retailers and wholesalers.The competitiveness of the alliances is based on the opportunity to fill existing market niches, offering differentiated “fresh” products with high “food safety control”for retailers selling fresh product ready to consume in high tech bags. The USAID environmental cooperation by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Environmental and Labor Excellence for CAFTA-DR Program established an alliance with fruits and vegetables processing plants, Neo-Alimentaria and with local farmers Grupo Primavera, with the support of Southern Specialties, US buyer which is interest in the development of new presentations as fresh broccoli florets or crowns for the east coast market, to produce fresh vegetables (mainly broccoli and sugar snap).     This alliance benefits directly 97 local productive units, and generates employment, directly or indirectly; to over 600 people and puts on market annually over 200 tons of new certified products. At the same time, it ensures a reduced environmental impact (reducing erosion and effluents) and improves workers’ health and security. In addition this new work methodology results for local farmers in a production increase, better prices for their agricultural inputs, and in the future, even access to financing mechanisms to continue growing.     Neo-Alimentaria is a Guatemalan business with over 10 years in the frozen food market. They export approximately 15 million pounds of finished products and give direct employment to more than 400 people, and benefit, directly or indirectly, approximately 600 people from this alliance.     As part of the business model to improve the environmental performance of producers and processors from Guatemala, this alliance shows the benefits of adopting environmental and labor standards under international certifications to reduce negative environmental impacts derived from the excessive use of pesticides, extensive and inadequate irrigation and disposal of hazardous waste among others.     The application of environmental and labor standards promotes purchase preference to those products that comply with these requirements and that adopt production and processing practices internationally accepted. At the same time, it enhances product quality by ensuring a reduced environmental impact and improves workers’ health and security including that of neighboring communities and the consumer.   In this way, the agricultural sector of Guatemala is more competitive, has access to more demanding markets with better prices for its differentiated product, and has a lower environmental impact.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Grenada Cocoa Association</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The program supports USAID&apos;s youth development strategy that seeks to provide youth especially those considered vulnerable or unattached with economic opportunities and ultimately reducing the risk to their participation in crime and violence. It will therefore provide opportunities for youth to be trained to support the cocoa/chocolate industry through internships as well as job assignments. It will also assist in stimulating those youth with an entrepreneurial focus. USAID/Barbados and Eatsern Caribbean (USAID) recently signed a cooperative agreement with the Grenada Cocoa Association (GCA) for an amount of $173,968. The initiative represents a partnership operating as Diamond Cocoa Estates (DCE) between the GCA and L.A. Burdick Grenada. The initiative will support the development of youth through a direct link with USAID&apos;s Caribbean Youth Empowerment Program (CYEP) that is being implemented by the International Youth Foundation on behalf of USAID in Grenada. The second phase of the CYEP is providing second-chance educational support to youth considered vulnerable and who need assistnace in job-training. Some of these youth will benefit from jobs, training or attachments working with DCE. In addition to the improvement in the local economy, the program is expected to support an improvement in issues such as security, unrest and instability in the communities served. The resources provided by USAID to the GCA will be used by them to add valuable equipment to the processing operations of the plant. This will enable DCE to process bulk chocolate produced from the cocoa provided by the GCA&apos;s farmers. This program will significantly boost Grenada&apos;s cocoa/chocolate industry.</Description>

<Description>1. Improve sustainable management of coastal economic resources in El Salvador.  2. Improve incomes of coastal community residents in El Salvador.  3. Improve environmental awareness among coastal community residents in El Salvador.  4. Improve sea turtle conservation in El Salvador. Coastal marine resources make an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy and are an important source of income for coastal residents. Because these resources are not well or sustainably managed, their contributions to the Salvadoran economy are at risk with impacts that fall heavily on the economically vulnerable coastal communities.     Since 2006, USAID/IMCCW has worked to improve Salvadoran natural resource management. In FY 2010 sea turtle conservation is one focus drawing attention to the broader need to improve coastal natural resource management and establish sustainable levels and methods of economic exploitation.    The state of sea turtles reflects the general state of Salvadoran coastal resources. Habitat degradation and unregulated, unsustainable collecting of the eggs of the four species of sea turtles nesting in El Salvador have brought a once abundant resource close to extinction with consequences that have affected thousands of families.    In February 2009 the Government of El Salvador banned any form of sea turtle commercialization. The economic impact would have fallen mostly on vulnerable tortugueros and their families. USAID/IMCCW and other organizations established a program that paid tortugueros to bring sea turtle eggs to beach hatcheries for protected incubation and release. This program succeeded in replacing lost tortugueros income, and released over 1 million sea turtle hatchlings. The program continues in 2011 as part of a long-term, national program of sea turtle conservation.    The Grupo 71-Costa del Sol Partnership will establish an alliance to support sea turtle hatchery operations on the Costa de Sol beach in eastern El Salvador. The partnership use seed funding from USAID/IMCCW to bring together Grupo 71- Costa del Sol and KM71 Costa del Sol Tortuguero Group to expand and sustain sea turtle egg collection activities and hatchery operations for at least five years.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Handwashing Initiative</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Handwashing Alliance (2001-2011), a USAID partnership with Colgate-Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, UNICEF, the World Bank, Centers for Disease Control, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (JHU), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and implemented by the Academy for Education Development, aimed to give families, schools, and communities in developing countries the power to prevent diarrhea and respiratory infections by supporting the universal practice of proper hand washing with soap. Benefits included improved hand washing behavior and diarrhea disease reduction, especially among children under five, and expansion of the soap market. USAID co-financed the partnership&apos;s Secretariat, participated on its three working groups, and helped to design and review materials produced. The private sector partners provided expertise and training in marketing, and P&amp;G and Unilever designed the outreach materials for the first annual Global Handwashing Day in 2008. The academic partners contributed to the Behavior Change Working Group, and LSHTM has been instrumental in designing and conducting research for several national handwashing initiatives and in designing the communications methodology that is utilized by the partnership. JHU conducted handwashing initiatives in several countries and has also shared designs for formative research and communication strategies for behavior change. Total project investment reached $7,348,000, with USAID investing $1.33 million, and partners contributing $5.883 million in cash and $135,000 in-kind.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Health Executive Education</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objectives of this alliance are to substantially improve the leadership, managerial and financial skills of 270 hospital managers in Egypt over a 3 year period through a ‘mini-MBA’ type training program to take place in Egypt. The training program will provide the hospital managers with new skills and introduce new ways of thinking/acting based on experiences from outside Egypt. The Global Development Alliance among USAID/Egypt, the Ministry of Health and Population and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America (“PhRMA”), a U.S. private association as representing multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in Egypt, EIPICO Pharmaceuticals, Pharco Corporation, and CDIMA Pharmaceuticals.   The Minister of Health and Population is undertaking the restructuring of Egypt’s health system and considers the improvement of the performance of its public hospitals a cornerstone of this plan. A program concentrating on the development of the managerial capabilities of hospital executives as many of the hospital executives is crucial for the progress of hospitals performance. Many of the hospital executives in Egypt lack the fundamental business skills necessary for any institution manager. Hence a program to strengthen their abilities to develop and practice leadership, decision-making, and financial skills is fundamental for the creation of a pipeline of future leaders. Having a group of executives sharing the same experience, language and management skills in the leading positions of the MOHP institutions ensures a harmony between the different actors involved in the reform of the health sector in Egypt. This, in turn, will lead to a less turbulent and sustainable restructuring process.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Health Initiatives for the Private Sector (HIPS)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The USAID Health Initiatives for the Private Sector (HIPS) Project works with the Ugandan business community to find cost-effective ways to ensure access to and encourage utilization of vital health services by company employees, their dependents, and members of the surrounding community. 
The project undertakes activities in the areas of prevention, treatment, and training to ensure that access to health programs are expanded through the local private sector.  HIPS accomplishes this task by partnering with companies to develop health information materials and peer education programs, conduct health fairs, facilitate access to lower-cost health products, and most importantly, expand access to critical AIDS and Tuberculosis treatments.  The HIPS project also aims to encourage the incorporation of orphans and other vulnerable children within company Corporate Social Responsibility strategies. 
The project aims to reach more than 200,000 Ugandans with prevention and treatment messages on HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, and Reproductive Health.  The project will also facilitate access for 1,500 people to free anti-retroviral drugs provided by the Ministry of Health, while providing training to 350 healthcare providers in AIDS treatment, as well as TB and HIV-related palliative care. 
Quantitative results of the project have been several. With the assistance of USAID and the German Development Services, James Finlay Tea company developed an AIDS workplace policy that covers all six (6) tea estates and trained 500 employees to date as peer educators.  HIPS also facilitated the accreditation of three (3) estate clinics that have access to free anti-retroviral medicine from the Ministry of Health.  Also in cooperation with the German Development Services Tilda Rice Uganda trained 300 employees as peer educators and distributed over 2500 mosquito nets.  Sixty (60) people in the heavily AIDS-impacted communities of Muhokya, Hamukungu, and Kahendero were trained as counselors/peer educators to support an existing AIDS treatment program.  Kinyara Sugar worked with HIPS to extend health services to the over 30,000 people within their catchment area.

During the life of the project, HIPS had built the capacity of two local private sector institutions, Federation of Uganda Employers (FUE) and Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA), to provide prevention related health services to their members. The partnerships’ success can be attributed to the systematic approach used in engaging the partners and to tailor the program to meet companies’ needs. HIPS realized that the success of a GDA was driven by a champion within the partnering company, such as a human resources director or a company doctor, who was highly engaged during the partnership-building process. The promotion or departure of a champion often affected the way a GDA was developed. This usually necessitated another round of meetings and negotiations for the health programs to be sustained. For instance, managerial changes required renewed reengagement efforts by the project.</Description>

<Description>The Helping Babies Breathe Alliance (2010-2012), a USAID partnership with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Saving Newborn Lives/Save the Children, Laerdal Medical, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), helped countries to expand high quality resuscitation services as part of a broader package of essential newborn care, including low birth weight, early and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal protection, clean cord care, and the early identification and management of infections. The alliance offered evidence-based training, high quality, affordable resuscitation equipment, and technical assistance to support countries in their efforts to improve coverage and quality of newborn resuscitation services. Between June 2010 and June 2012, HBB alliance trained about 80,000 health providers in 48 countries, with 21 supported by USAID. Over 70,000 HBB training workbooks and 5,000 flip chart sets were sold on a not-for-profit basis, and almost 34,000 workbooks and 3,000 flip chart sets were donated. Additionally, 82,000 bag/masks, 93,000 suction bulbs, and 23,000 NeoNatalie simulators were sold on a not-for-profit basis, and 4,000 simulators were donated. The Tanzania pilot study indicated a 38% newborn mortality reduction among approximately 20,000 deliveries, with final results anticipated higher. Eight countries have introduced a new outcome indicator: asphyxiated babies resuscitated successfully, and have reported resuscitating about 800 newborns, with a success rate in the 70 to 98% range.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Hepatitis B Catch-Up Vaccination Program in Georgia</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation is carrying out a hepatitis B catch-up vaccination program for at-risk healthcare workers, medical students, and adolescents in Georgia. All 13-year-olds in the capital Tbilisi and all medical students and at-risk healthcare workers throughout Georgia will be eligible for screening for and vaccination against hepatitis B. The program will include training seminars for chief medical doctors, vaccinators &amp; medical workers; print materials for parents. The Minister of Labour, Health, and Social Affairs of Georgia, Alexander Kvitashvili, and the head of the National Center for Disease Control, Dr. Paata Imnadze, requested the assistance of the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation (RVF) in establishing this hepatitis B catch-up vaccination program for at-risk healthcare workers, medical students, and adolescents.  In 2001-2002 the government of Georgia incorporated hepatitis B vaccination into the routine childhood vaccination schedule. All newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within the first day of life and complete the series of three doses by about 6 months of age. When the program to prevent the vertical transmission of hepatitis B started there was no defined epidemiology of the burden of hepatitis B in society. Beginning in December 2005, at the request of the government of Georgia, the RVF formulated a program to screen the entire cohort of pregnant women to indentify carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and to enhance the protective efficacy of the extant neonatal hepatitis B vaccination program by adding a dose of passive immunity for newborns of carrier mothers using hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG).  Since August 2006 a total of 148,000 pregnant women have been screened for the carrier state of hepatitis B; of this total over 3% have been confirmed to be positive. When these data were presented to Georgian health officials, they immediately recognized the magnitude of the problem of hepatitis B infection in Georgian society. Since roughly 1 in 10 individuals infected with hepatitis B become chronic carriers of surface antigen, the discovered rate of 3% means that among women of childbearing age 30% may have acquired hepatitis B infection to that point in their lives. It is reasonable to assume that the risk of hepatitis B infection extends to all groups of society and not just pregnant women. Amongst healthcare workers the problem of hepatitis B infection may be even more serious because of occupational exposure. Further clarification of this epidemiology in healthcare workers is urgently needed.   As with all RVF-supported programs, this program is being implemented entirely through the existing public health infrastructure by local health care workers, so that from the very start the Ministry of Health and local healthcare workers have full ownership of the program. It is expected that the government of Georgia will provide full funding of the program by 2012</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Higher Engineering Education Alliance Program/The Vocational University Leadership and Innovation Institute (HEEAP-VULLI)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Through the Higher Engineering Education Alliance Program, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Arizona State University Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering (ASU), and Intel Corporation are collaborating with top technical universities and vocational colleges in Vietnam to transform engineering education from passive, theory-based curriculum and instruction to active, project-based approaches. The engine of the Alliance Program is faculty training and mentorship. Professors from eight colleges and universities attend a six-week Summer Institute at ASU, where they prioritize reforms and work together on curriculum design each summer. This first cohort is already implementing changes in curriculum, designing new courses and revamping labs based on improved teaching methods and new learning outcomes. Additional faculty will be trained each year and all will return home to train their peers on new methodologies.  The Alliance provides project assistance and mentoring for faculty throughout the program. Taking a systems-approach, HEEAP also works with university leadership and the Ministry of Education and Training to support reform.    All program activities, new curricula, and teaching methods are aligned with the U.S. Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) standards.  One participating university, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, has joined with ABET for fast track accreditation and, if achieved, would be the first university with ABET accreditation in Vietnam and one of a select few in South East Asia.      Vietnam’s emerging high-tech industry has strong economic potential. With the right infrastructure and support, the higher engineering education systems has the opportunity to develop dynamic graduates that contributes to global productivity including technology manufacturing, research and development, and hardware/software design. HEEAP provides a framework that can be expanded with more institutions, more faculty and additional programming to match industry needs as it develops.  The engines of HEEAP are curriculum reforms and faculty capacity building. VULII is HEEAP&apos;s expansion, which aims to increase understanding of institutional research, evaluation, management principles, financial planning, assessment and quality assurance.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Horta Brazil (INMED Partnerships for Children)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Horta Brasil (Garden Brazil) alliance is a three-year initiative intended to combat hunger and promote nutritional self-sufficiency for children and families in the north and northeast of the country.  The overall goal of the alliance is to reduce hunger and improve health among approximately 100,000 poor children, enhance long-term food security for local families, and boost income generating activities through the sale of surplus produce.  These goals will be achieved by increasing the availability of nutritious produce through school gardens and nutrition education for children, teachers, school cafeteria workers and mothers of school-age children; treating children for intestinal parasitic infections that rob them of vital nutrients; treating them for micronutrient deficiencies that compromise their physical and cognitive development; educating them in good nutrition practices and preventive health, hygiene and sanitation measures; and increasing their access to clean drinking water.  FY 2005 was the first year of implementation of the Horta Brazil program.  The results to date, both in terms of resource leveraging and program accomplishments, are outstanding, making this initiative an exemplary alliance program.  With the support of USAID and partners, Horta Brasil has successfully taken root in 15 of Brazil&apos;s poorest communities in eight states.  In FY 2005, INMED•reached more than 83,000 children in more than 350 schools with education, treatment, and nutrient supplementation.  INMED also trained 415 teachers as &quot;multiplier&quot; trainers, who in turn trained more than 2,400 of their colleagues in the program&apos;s preventive health, hygiene, sanitation, nutrition and gardening topics.  Other activities included the training of over 900 cafeteria workers in nutrition and food safety.  As a result, 75 schools have incorporated produce from school gardens to improve the nutritional quality of lunches, with 25 other schools currently in the process of planting gardens and more than 200 more preparing to plant their own gardens in FY 2006.  
INMED also conducted biomedical examinations and anthropomorphic measurements among 2,750 children to determine nutritional status and prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection; administered deworming medication to nearly 74,000 children; and administered iron and multivitamin supplements to 1,500 anemic and borderline anemic children. In addition, INMED has also successfully engaged the support and participation of new government and school officials as key stakeholders in the success of the Horta Brasil program.  USAID&apos;s partners have all met their initial obligation to the project, and have since made additional commitments.  Monsanto Brasil and the Monsanto Fund made a three-year commitment to Horta Brasil from the outset of the project; GE Brasil and the GE Foundation made a two-year commitment at the outset of the project, which was scheduled to end June 30, 2006.  GE has now nearly doubled the amount of the annual commitment and helped to add a basic education component to the partnership, beginning in October 2005, and has extended its commitment to September 30, 2008.  El Paso Energy made a one-year commitment to the partnership at the outset.  It has now extended that commitment for an additional two years, increased the annual funding, and brought in one of its subsidiary companies, TermoNorte.  Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen-Cilag made a commitment of drugs and funding for one year.  They have provided all the drugs for the current project year, and doubled the amount of funding committed this year.  In addition, they have tripled the amount of treatment drugs to be contributed in 2006. Funding for next year will be decided before the end of 2005.

<Description>1. Improve sustainable management of coastal economic resources in El Salvador.  2. Improve incomes of coastal community residents in El Salvador.  3. Improve environmental awareness among coastal community residents in El Salvador.  4. Improve sea turtle conservation in El Salvador. Coastal marine resources make an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy and are an important source of income for coastal residents. Because these resources are not well or sustainably managed, their contributions to the Salvadoran economy are at risk with impacts that fall heavily on the economically vulnerable coastal communities.     Since 2006, USAID/IMCCW has worked to improve Salvadoran natural resource management. In FY 2010 sea turtle conservation is one focus drawing attention to the broader need to improve coastal natural resource management and establish sustainable levels and methods of economic exploitation.    The state of sea turtles reflects the general state of Salvadoran coastal resources. Habitat degradation and unregulated, unsustainable collecting of the eggs of the four species of sea turtles nesting in El Salvador have brought a once abundant resource close to extinction with consequences that have affected thousands of families.    In February 2009 the Government of El Salvador banned any form of sea turtle commercialization. The economic impact would have fallen mostly on vulnerable tortugueros and their families. USAID/IMCCW and other organizations established a program that paid tortugueros to bring sea turtle eggs to beach hatcheries for protected incubation and release. This program succeeded in replacing lost tortugueros income, and released over 1 million sea turtle hatchlings. The program continues in 2011 as part of a long-term, national program of sea turtle conservation.    The HSBC Partnership will establish an alliance to support sea turtle hatchery operations in the San Diego, El Salvador beach in eastern El Salvador. San Diego is a particularly important foraging and nesting area for hawksbill sea turtles. The partnership will use seed funding from USAID/IMCCW to bring together HSBC and the San Diego Tortuguero group to continue sea turtle egg collection activities and hatchery operations for at least five years.</Description>

<Description>The Impact Reporting and Investment Standards Alliance (2009-present), a USAID partnership with Rockefeller Foundation, the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), and JP Morgan Chase, aims to rate the social and environmental return on financial investments by providing a common framework for defining, tracking, and reporting their performance. IRIS addresses a major barrier to growth of the impact investing industry – the lack of transparency in how funds define, track, and report on the social and environmental performance of their capital. Achievements through 2010 include six organizations piloting Version 1.0 of the IRIS taxonomy, release of the IRIS Data Aggregator (a technology platform compiling data and providing benchmarks and other reporting), participation of more than 100 people in 
webinar trainings on IRIS development and adoption, and the scheduled release of IRIS 2.0.</Description>

<Description>Georgia Business Climate Reform Project (GBCR) and USAID SME Support Project are collaborating with AmCham and the Georgian Chamber of Commerce on a survey of large Georgian businesses to identify opportunities to substitute Georgian-produced goods and services for imports.  Approximately 200 businesses will be interviewed throughout Georgia.  When completed, the survey will provide a basis for concrete recommendations.  We anticipate at least two things will be required: direct firm-level technical support to Georgian producers to help them solve the specific problems that make them unable to deliver the quality, quantity, and reliability that buyers require; and a reform of the last mile.  GBCR has identified a number of specific obstacles to export and import substitution that the GOG has been unwilling to address, in large part because there has been no champion.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Improving the Georgian Hazelnut Producing Sector</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Parties seek to share their respective strengths, experiences, technologies, methodologies, and resources (including human, in-kind, and monetary) in order to achieve the following Goals:   Development of Georgian hazelnut producing industry,  Improved quality of Georgian hazelnuts with the introduction of modern practices and technology, and  Improved yields of existing hazelnut orchards as a result of above. The Georgia EPI, a USAID-funded project, implemented by Deloitte Consulting LLP, envisions private sector-lead development as a key driver in achieving economic prosperity in Georgia. Agriculture dominates Georgia&apos;s economic landscape, but the sector is plagued by a wide range of challenges that inhibit productivity and growth. Inadequate market access, inefficient production practices, limited access to capital and poor infrastructure are among them. Resolution of these issues combined with linkages to potential markets will have far-reaching benefits for Georgia. EPI will target these challenges by linking Georgian agriculture producers and processors to new markets and by increasing their competitiveness in meeting the requirements of those markets.   AGG is a limited liability company created under the laws of Georgia by the Ferrero Group, the largest global purchaser of hazelnuts, and maintains a long-term strategic vision of both growing and diversifying the supply of hazelnuts.  The Parties share the following goals:   Development of Georgian Hazelnut Producing Industry  Improved Quality of Georgian Hazelnuts with the introduction of modern practices and technology.   Eventually Improved Yields of existing hazelnut orchards as a result of above     The Parties intend to focus joint activities around the following objectives:  Train Georgian Farmers   Use new hazelnut plantation and nursery owned by AGG as demonstration area and create knowledge plots to demonstrate relevant technologies to Georgian farmers, orchardists, and agronomists.  Use existing old orchards, owned by AGG to demonstrate the technologies required to renovate old orchards to higher standards within the aim to achieve higher quality nuts and probable increased hazelnut production yields in future.</Description>

<Description>The object of this alliance is to provide economic opportunities and promote role models of Roma entrepreneurship in seven Roma communities in Bulgaria, thus contributing to an increase in ethnic tolerance in Bulgarian society.  USAID will contribute a total $350,000 for loan capital from the E&amp;E Bureau GDA Incentive Fund, and $100,000 from USAID/Bulgaria for personnel, travel, supplies, contractual and other direct costs related to program activities, in an effort to increase the image of Roma entrepreneurs.  USTOI and MicroFund will each contribute $350,000 from their existing capital.  The alliance-based program in the regions of Sofia and Sofia district, Sliven, Pazardzhik, Burgas, Omurtag, Razgrad, and Silistra is expected to create a microfinance network for vulnerable and ethnically discriminated Roma groups, and thereby address broader developmental goals such as poverty alleviation, economic development, and tolerance for Roma.  USAID support will thus increase business opportunities for Roma communities that will directly affect their social status and also help shift public perceptions of Roma entrepreneurs and the image of the Roma population in Bulgaria.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Indonesia Tsunami Warning System (Ina-TEWS) Project</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>A Public-Private Partnership to support Ina-TEWS allows U.S. private sector concerns operating in Indonesia to make important contributions to the safety of Indonesians at risk from tsunamis and other coastal natural hazards.  By combining the unique assets and strengths offered by U.S. companies and U.S. technical and foreign assistance agencies we can do much more together than either could do alone. In May 2007, the U.S. Embassy and U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started collaboration to establish the Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning System (Ina-TEWS) Public Private Partnership.  The Partnership offers concerned U.S. corporations doing business here a unique opportunity to make a difference for Indonesians living in tsunami-prone areas.      The Partnership allows U.S. companies to contribute directly to the State Department under special provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act.  Contributions will be transferred to technical agencies like NOAA and USAID, established international or nongovernmental organizations, or qualified private sector contractors to implement projects in support of Ina-TEWS.    NOAA will lead a cross-agency management team to identify requirements and projects and determine distribution of funds to implementing partners.  Although the Government of Indonesia is an active partner in the Partnership, we will not transfer donated funds to Indonesian agencies.  The management team will report regularly to Partnership members on project activities and progress against milestones.    There can be no question that a robust Ina-TEWS is of great benefit to the people of Indonesia.  Corporations can enter into the Partnership confident that their contributions will be wisely an efficiently invested to meet needs and priorities endorsed by the Government of Indonesia.</Description>

<Description>The INJAZ al-Arab Initiative (2004-2009), a USAID partnership with Citibank, Mastercard, Junior Achievement, Middle East Partnership Initiative, and Ministries of Education, sought to mentor and cultivate the next generation of Arab business leaders. The alliance sent senior-level corporate volunteers to share their professional experience, know-how, and success stores with Arab youth. Students in 12 countries across the Middle East and North Africa learned how the banking sector supports business and industry, how to manage their own budgets and follow stocks, and how to set up a model enterprise with a business plan from company startup to final liquidation. INJAZ al-Arab programs offered students education opportunities to strengthen their innovative capacity, deepen their understanding of the business world, and improve their professional qualifications to enable success in the global economy. Simultaneously, the alliance fostered a sense of responsibility for investing their resources in the futures of the region’s youth among business leaders. INJAZ al-Arab programs reached more than 500,000 students and engaged 10,000 volunteers. After three years in Oman, INJAZ programs experienced 189% growth, and 101 public schools were adopted through the program.</Description>

<Description>New Manufacturing Plant for Building, Sandwich, Insulated Panels and Metal  Clad Insulated Panels (‘Sandwich’). Most building construction performed in Afghanistan is brick construction with an RCC structural frame and roofing system. The cost of materials is cheap when compared with alternative building systems, but the construction process is time consuming, requiring multiple activities to complete a project. ISPs can be attached to lightly gauged, framed structures such as wall and roof cladding.  This adds very little weight to the structure while providing excellent thermal resistance and eliminating the need for exterior and interior finishing since the panels are all pre-painted. The superior insulating properties of ISPs also increase thermal efficiency thereby reducing costs associated with air conditioning and heating while promoting “green” structures.</Description>

<Description>The proposed Innovations in Technology-Assisted Learning for Educational Quality project (INTALEQ) is a Global Development Alliance that will help Yemeni students “step up” to the future by giving them a chance to master the types of skills necessary to flourish in the 21st century.  INTALEQ (which means “step up” or launch in Arabic) offers a replicable model for leveraging the power and pull of technology, not just to teach computer and Internet skills, but to improve core teaching and learning in Yemeni high schools, particularly in the essential areas of math and science.  INTALEQ  has a number of targets: the development of digital content materials that facilitate improved learning of concepts and skills based on and reinforcing the Yemeni curriculum for 10th grade math and science (1,500 students/beneficiaries as measured by 10 schools/30 classes served); the development, testing and launch of an easy-to-use and sustainable dissemination system (e.g. MOE portal with digital library and model Learning Resource Center for teachers) for new digital materials and other educational content that will serve as a basis for more widespread and efficient dissemination of educational resources and capacity building materials in Yemen (50 teachers and 38 supervisors/88 beneficiaries as measured by 10 schools served); and improvement in the capacity of teachers and administrators to promote and support greater student learning, including the acquisition of 21st century skills (50 teachers, 10 principals and 38 supervisors/ 99 beneficiaries as measured by 99 teachers and administrators trained).</Description>

<Description>Goal is to increase the use of ICT in education, enable last mile Internet connectivity, and support ICT usage by small-and medium sized businesses to enhance overall economic development opportunities. By connecting USAID missions with local Intel offices, partners leveraged complementary assets to expand opportunities for thousands of people. Intel worked with its partners to develop appropriate software, hardware, and connectivity solutions, and provided curricula and training to improve education through the effective use of technology. USAID brought resources, networks, development expertise, and knowledge of developing countries to the alliance. Within the first year of planning, Intel and USAID launched two project-level collaborations in Vietnam and Indonesia, which helped to lay the groundwork from which the partners could move forward and extend the relationship more broadly. In 2008, further collaborations were launched in Ghana, Guatemala, Egypt, Kenya, West Bank/Gaza, and Yemen, benefiting hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. Examples of partnerships enabled by the Framework include:
• The Vietnam WiMAX Alliance, which installed WiMAX technology throughout Lao Cai province in rural northern Vietnam, offering citizens access to cost-efficient broadband Internet and VoIP telephone services, improving the business environment, education opportunities, and the availability of medical services. 
• Intel contribution of 100 Classmate PCs to USAID’s One-to-One program, which brings technology into public schools in Guatemala, enhancing access and developing skills. 
• The establishment of a three-year, $1.5 million alliance in Indonesia to train teachers on the classroom use of computer technology to improve basic education.</Description>

Using a localized version of the Intel® Teach Program –  the Getting Started course translated into Bahasa Indonesian – primary and secondary school teachers learned to incorporate technology into lesson plans, create assessment tools to help teachers meet educational goals, and train fellow teachers on the Intel® Teach Program. Through the initiative, over 1,300 master teachers from 461 schools were trained, and master teachers trained during the first year of the alliance trained more than 2,500 additional Participant Teachers (PTs) at their respective schools by March 2008. By 2010, the alliance had trained more than 15,000 teachers in Indonesia. Total project investment reached $1.5 million, with USAID contributing $500,000 and Intel investing $1 million.</Description>

<Description>Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) is a sub-partner to Wits Health Consortium. IMAGE provides microfinance and gender/HIV training to women to empower them economically and build their resilience against HIV and reduce GBV. This project has been funded for 3 years for implementation in 3 provinces of Gauteng, North West and KwaZulu-Natal. IMAGE&apos;s strategic objectives include: to improve women’s economic wellbeing and financial independence; to reduce vulnerability to HIV and GBV; and, to foster wider-community mobilization to address the key drivers of HIV. To address these objectives, IMAGE provides a community-based intervention that combines group-based microfinance with a 12-15 month gender and HIV training curriculum known as Sisters for Life (SFL) that targets women. 
IMAGE has re-designed its monitoring systems to ensure it can adequately track sessions completed by participants, as USAID has suggested 6 sessions as ‘core’.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Istrian Development Agency - IDA</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Foreign investment is critical for Croatia to build a vibrant market economy.   The primary goal of CIPO is to increase investors&apos; awareness of Croatia&apos;s investment potential, to encourage investors to undertake site visits to Croatia to explore potential investment projects, and ultimately to generate and support actual investment projects in the country.   
This alliance brings together several key partners that will work together to make sure that Croatia’s success story is told to the widest number of potential investors.  It will create a Croatia-specific investment promotion unit in the Regional Investment Promotion Office in Vienna that will reach out and convince potential investors that Croatia is a great place to invest.  Vienna is an ideal place, since Austria is the largest foreign investor to Croatia and the best place for new investors to search for opportunities.  In addition to an active investment promotion office in Vienna, CIPO partners from the regional investment promotion agencies throughout Croatia will welcome investors and show them the benefits of investing in their communities, and will be responsible for “closing the deal” with investors. 
The budget for the initial 18 months of the Croatian representative in Vienna project is approximately 2.5 million kuna, while a supplementary program budget will be directed primarily at marketing activities and investment opportunities in priority sectors in Croatia.  In addition, important private sector partners and state agencies (FINA, HBOR, PBZ, Podravka, RBA, Uljanik Plovidba, Zagrebacka Banka, Agrippina, Microgroup, Pastor, Selectio and ZAPI), committed to attracting investment in Croatia, also contributed to this alliance through donations.</Description>

<Description>The IT in Education Partnership focuses on ten primary and junior secondary schools. The Partnership will build free-standing IT labs at each school, which will be outfitted with cutting-edge technology provided by the private sector partners. In addition to enhancing the learning experiences of the students, the labs also provide an opportunity to showcase US technology for the Indonesian Ministry of Education, paving the way for future commercial opportunities for US firms. Building on an existing USAID program with the Ministry of Education to support ICT and teacher training, each school will receive a state-of-the-art computer lab, with equipment, training, and technical support from the private sector Task Force partners.  The Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) has committed resources for construction of the lab buildings at these ten locations. In the longer term, there may be additional support for GOI or others to expand the program.  Involvement and commitment from local government will be key to enhancing chances for longer-term support and sustainability.  The IT in Education Partnership focuses on ten primary and junior secondary schools, two in each of the following five provinces: North Sumatra, West/Central/East Java, South Sulawesi.  The The first IT lab (the pilot location) is currently under construction in Karawang, West Java.  If it proves successful, the group will move on to additional locations, with the goal of building all ten labs.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Junior Achievement (JA) Angola</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Junior Achievement is a global organization active in more than 100 countries around the world.  It has a range of programs that help young people to acquire the skills and confidence that will enable them to live their lives productively.  It has a special emphasis on transferring the life skills critical to economic success, with many of these skills gained through practical, hands-on learning experience.

Junior Achievement Angola has introduced the following programs to Angola: the Company Program, Personal Economics Program and the Job Shadow Program. 

Through the Company Program, upper grade students organize, operate and liquidate an actual business enterprise with the support and guidance of their teachers and volunteer consultants from the local business community.  In Personal Economics Program, middle grade students explore career options and learn fundamental skills about managing money, budgeting, and the pros and cons of using and abusing credit.  The Job Shadow Program introduces students to possible future careers through one-day, on-site orientation or through more extensive internships.



For Junior Achievement to be successful, local business participation is essential.  In Angola, businesses are participating by making cash contributions to support program operations; by making staff available to teach and mentor young people; by serving on the board of directors; by sponsoring events; or by demonstrating interest in numerous other ways.</Description>

<Description>The Kenya Value Girls is a four year program funded by Nike Foundation and USAID to offer young women access to high growth value chains that are safer and more lucrative for them. The program focuses on improving the young women’s safety and security by facilitating access to alternative livelihood options; enhancing their income by increasing their participation into high growth value chains; developing and communicating an effective model for economically empowering girls and young women. The Value Girls Program is being implemented by Cardno Emerging Markets USA, Ltd. around Lake Victoria in Nyanza and Western provinces of Kenya. The overarching goal of the Value Girls Program is to improve the social-economic welfare of girls and young women between the ages of 14-24 years by increasing and strengthening their participation in proven, high growth value chains. With support from young women and other important stakeholders, the program selected Poultry and Vegetable production as alternative sources of livelihood for the girls and young women that are living on the beaches of Lake Victoria, where the program is working.  HIV/AIDS prevalence is very high along the beaches due to the transactional sex relationship that expose girls and young women to the AIDS scotch.  The two sectors, Vegetables (local vegetables, tomatoes, and onions) and Poultry (improved indigenous chicken) were selected out of a large number of other potential sectors primarily due to their suitability for the girls’ situations and their high potential to increase incomes.    In June 2010, a partnership with USAID was established through a Global Development Alliance (GDA).  This partnership added significant resources to the Value Girls Program and enabled it to address specific gaps that were identified in the program.  It also enabled the program to scale up and increase its outreach to about 2000 girls and young women from the original target of 1000.  The scaled up operation will promote large scale community dialogue to address cultural beliefs that marginalize girls and young women and also pro-actively engage boys and men in the same dialogue.  USAID and Nike Foundation are resource partners while Cardno Emerging Markets serves as the implementing partner.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Kenya Youth Employment and Empowerment Initiative</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This initiative consists of two components: 1) A summit to mobilize and engage key stakeholders in youth development in the government, business, higher education, private, faith-based and community sectors to make commitments toward job creation and training that will sustain the efforts of Vision 2030; and 2) a Secretariat as the sustainable mechanism to convene the summit, engage the stakeholders, create the blueprint for action and ensure follow up on commitments over the next two years. Nazarene Compassionate Ministries, Inc. (NCMI), in partnership with Africa Nazarene University (ANU), will develop the Kenya Youth Empowerment and Employment Initiative, a two-year effort that will promote education, job training, job creation and moral development. ANU will serve as the Secretariat of the Initiative, it will establish and implementing a system of program and project accountability that will measure the impact of the commitments made by Summit participants. Funding from USAID will be utilized for the technical support required to build the capacity of the Secretariat to direct and administer the entire two-year Initiative.  ANU’s role as the Secretariat will, in turn, ensure successful implementation of the commitments made from government, education, community and business leaders to advance the economic and social goals of Kenya. As a logical extension of implementing the recommendations and action steps coming out  a stakeholder  summit, ANU will seek funding to develop a Center for Excellence on Public Private Partnerships to serve as an incubator for data collection, research and analysis, documentation of existing stakeholders and current efforts already underway, identifying future opportunities for job creation in the five strategic enterprise areas (SEAs), and convening the funding and implementing partners to stimulate job creation in each of the five SEAs.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Koko Plus</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Under a trilateral partnership hailed by the Prime Minister of Japan, USAID, JICA, and Ajinomoto joined forces to pilot a product called “Koko Plus,” a nutritional supplement for children aged 6-24 months. The sweet-tasting additive to porridge is being tested through two innovative approaches, hinged on the different quintiles and geographic variability in Ghana. In the more economically disadvantaged Northern Region, Koko Plus is being sold through rural Village Savings and Loan Associations. In the relatively more affluent Southern Ghana, Koko Plus is being sold through a demand creation and market driven approach. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is undertaking the monitoring and evaluation of both models while The Nevin Scrimshaw International Nutrition Foundation (INIF) is finalizing an efficacy trial. The cost of local production of the Koko Plus is estimated at $203,500 for the year, which is paid for by Ajinomoto who also supports the work of INIF, totaled for the reporting period at $480,000. The costs of running both models are supported by JICA, Ajinomoto, and USAID; in total the leverage is 2:1, that is, for every $1 USAID dollar, it is matched by $2, JICA/Ajinomoto dollars.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Kyrgyz Agro-Input Enterprise Development Follow-On (III)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The KAED Follow-On Partnership stems from the success of the original KAED (2001-2008) and second KAED (2008 to 2010) partnerships. The original project was implemented to develop the private sector agri-input supply network to serve farmers&apos; needs and help them increase yields and profits. KAED resulted in the dramatic increase in use of improved seed and fertilizer, and the formation of an effective trade association of agri-input dealers. The partnership also trained 9,100 farmers, helped project-supported dealers improve their revenues from $2 million to $45 million, and influenced agriculutre policy by helping the association to remove the 20% value-added tax on fertizlier imports. KAED II activities were built on the success of past achievements, and sought sustainability on all levels particularly involving agribusiness and agriculture value chain members and associations. Primary activities included registering new seed varieties entering Kyrgyzstan and certification of 4,000 mt. of high-quality seed produced from USAID&apos;s collaboration with ICARDA, establishing a GDA with Eurasia Group to increase domestic production of corn and edible oil, transferring knowledge to farmers about best wheat-growing practices, procuring and distributing up to 2,400 mt of livestock feed to take care of 70,000 dairy cows, and introducing genetic cow breeds with high yield and quality milk. KAED Follow-On aims to increase agricultural productivity and farmer incomes through providing farmers access to improved seed during the 2011 two-month spring planting season and to promote market participation by more progressive smallholder farmers. Supported under USAID&apos;s Economic Development Fund, the program is providing seeds to approximately 30,000 selected farmers. An estimated 160 agricultural cooperatives and 81 seed enterprises in 42 rayons (districts) in all seven oblasts (provinces) throughout Kyrgyzstan will be involved.</Description>

<Description>NASA, USAID, Department of State, and NIKE joined together to form LAUNCH in an effort to identify, showcase and support innovative approaches to sustainability challenges through a series of forums. LAUNCH searches for visionaries, whose world-class ideas, technologies or programs show great promise for making tangible impacts on society. Through the next Launch series, 10 innovators and 40 thought leaders will come together to address an issue that affects every human: health.  Sustaining quality of life on Earth and in space requires transformative advances in science and technology, along with new models, policies and behaviors that will guide human development. The search for innovative technology solutions to ensure healthy astronauts orbiting the planet mirrors healthcare challenges faced by providers throughout the world. The same requirements for simple, rugged, ultra portable, low power devices to provide remote diagnostic capability serves dual needs for humans living within the extreme environments on and off the planet. Targeting preventative health measures within the first twenty years of life offers a unique opportunity to change the human condition for this and future generations.     LAUNCH seeks innovations that are preventive with a focus on nutrition, exercise, and health care. Specifically, LAUNCH is seeking innovations in providing and improving:   Optimal nutrition (access, choice, and quality of nutritious food and required nutrients)   Regular participation in physical activity and healthy lifestyle choices.   Participation in primary preventive health care including supporting infrastructure, such as diagnostic and monitoring technology   Through a series of forums focused on key challenge areas, including water, air, food, and energy, LAUNCH gives thought leaders a venue for evaluating creative ideas among peers and joining in collaborative, solution-driven discussions. Following the forum, the LAUNCH Accelerator team will provide individual support to each innovator to help integrate LAUNCH forum recommendations, and move each innovation closer to successful implementation.</Description>

<Description>The USAID investment of $550,000 over two years is part of a coordinated series of programs—totaling $1,100,000—to promote management, transformation and marketing of lesser-known species (LKS), contributing to a proactive conservation agenda emphasizing ecological, economic, and social stability in forest ecosystems of global importance.  Peruvian producers will have increased awareness of LKS and improved business and technical capacity to produce a high-quality, value added sustainable supply of LKS, bringing an incentive for adequate Peruvian Amazon management.  The alliance will also distribute marketing materials on LKS in Peruvian, US, and other international markets.  Private sector partners will incorporate species into their production lines, increasing economic value asssociated with sustainable forest management.  The results achieved include increased awareness and demand for two new forestry species to be used for the wood transformation industry, which has brought new value to the forest. It also developed the local capacity to identify new species for the timber industry.  The Activity ended in FY 2006.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Linking markets and marine conservation (Sea Delight)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This alliance is promoted within the environmental commitments of the Central American and the Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement and the United States so that big buyers promote the adoption of environmental standards with their suppliers and other stakeholders of the value chain. The establishment of these alliances demonstrates the interest of the local businesses in ensuring compliance under the treaty and their willingness to take part in its commitments and benefits. The adoption and application of environmental standards promotes the exchange of “J” hooks for circular hooks with an appropriate size to capture adult mahi mahi species. Circular hooks reduce the severe hooking of sea turtles and can be de-hooked, causing less harm to them and ensuring their release in good conditions, with higher probability of survival at sea. On the other hand, the increased size of the circular hook reduces the catch of juvenile species without affecting the catch of bigger fishes. This safeguards the mahi mahi population and ensures a higher long-term profitability of fishing activities.     Fishermen participate in trainings on de-hooking techniques for sea turtles trapped in long-lines and also on the importance of keeping the cold chain to ensure product quality.   Good fishing practices are monitored and registered by a program of voluntary observers on board that accompany fishing activities and certify the application of improved practices and collect data for the regional database that evaluates and guides the sustainable management of mahi mahi populations.     The USAID environmental cooperation is also promoting an innovative tracking system that ensures the traceability of the product from its catch until it reaches the final client. It also verifies that the commercialized product has been caught under environmental standards that comply with quality and food safety requirements.     Within this alliance, around 150 fishermen of the Nicaraguan Pacific Coast are being trained in best fishing practices according to environmental and labor standards. Also, the training has built the capacity of 20 independent observers. The change of hooks and the application of best practices have resulted in over 90% effectiveness in the liberation of sea turtles caught by incidental catch.     On the other hand, the three processing plants of fish and shellfish EXPOMAR, MARINSA and Nicafish, which embrace cleaner production methodologies, have achieved environmental improvements with annual savings of 17-31% on water use, 5%-28% of energy use, and a 4%-10% reduction of CO2 eq ton from their environmental footprint. The enhanced efficiency of resource use in their processes increases their competitiveness in the national, regional and international market.</Description>

<Description>The Linking Producers in the Northern Zone of El Salvador to Sustainable Markets Program is a Global Development Alliance (GDA) that seeks to link producers and buyers of fruits and vegetables in El Salvador as well as integrate environmental standards into the supply chain, from production practices to the sourcing of environmentally compliant goods. USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the Calleja Group, and the farmer-owned cooperative El Salvador Produce are collaborating through a GDA to enhance the incomes and competitiveness of agricultural producers in El Salvador’s Northern Zone and to streamline delivery capacity of fruits and vegetables in the region to points of sales. As the overall goal the proposed alliance aims to generate increased incomes and employment for 6,048 small-scale farmers in El Salvador’s Northern Zone.  The GDA will establish a Super Selectos’ agriculture multiservice center in the corridor between San Salvador and the Northern Zone, and link it to producer-managed collection centers (CAS). The center is connected to a cold chain that extends to the Super Selectos supermarkets, thus fully integrating the cold chain from small farmer fields to supermarkets across El Salvador.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Living Museums in the Sea</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This program will establish four marine protected areas in the Caribbean Sea just off of the coast of the Dominican Republic, in order to protect endangered biodiversity, as well as the historical, cultural and natural resources, through a program centered around a recently discovered shipwreck in a prominent tourist destination.  Regardless of their location, shipwrecks are among the most requested recreational diving destinations worldwide.  There are many excellent examples of state, federal, and international shipwreck parks, preserves, and sanctuaries that promote shipwrecks as cultural resources with significant historical and recreational values.  However, Indiana University’s innovative approach promotes shipwrecks as an integral part of the environment, forming equilibrium where the historical, cultural and biological resources are significant.  Particularly in warm Caribbean waters, a shipwreck offers the unique opportunity to incorporate the biological biodiversity associated with the shipwreck and its surrounding marine environment into an innovative “Living Museum” concept, where submerged historical, cultural and natural resources are respected.  Recognizing the international interest created by the discovery of the 1699 Captain Kidd shipwreck, the “Cara Merchant,” and the impending need to protect the shipwreck from treasure hunters or amateur looters, Indiana University (IU) proposed the establishment of the site as an Underwater Preserve.  Unlike the many marine protected areas previously established in the Dominican Republic, the Captain Kidd Preserve is expected to be a no-take zone, protecting both the cultural and biological resources.  As a newly established Preserve, the Captain Kidd Preserve would feature the prominent pile of 17th century cannons and anchors as representative of the only pirate ship ever discovered in the Caribbean, and one of only three discovered in the Americas.  Beyond these significant archaeological features the biologically diverse ecosystem includes numerous stands of threatened elkhorn corals (Acropora palmata) and the rare pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindricus).  By establishing the Captain Kidd shipwreck as a no-take zone which was nonetheless readily accessible and interpreted for visitation, the site would be a sustainable resource for present and future generations.</Description>

<Description>The Last Mile Initiative (2006-2008), a USAID partnership with Qualcomm, Dialog Telecom, and the National Development Bank of Sri Lanka, and implemented by Synergy Strategies Group (SSG) Advisors, used an innovative franchise approach – franchise in a box (telecenter-in-a-box) – to create a profitable and sustainable business model for extending ICT services and connectivity to rural consumers. The franchise approach, coined Easy Seva, removed barriers to entry, such as high connectivity costs, by aggregating demand and providing customers with wireless Internet access, personal computer usage, and broadband telephone services. Some centers also offered online training opportunities and banking services. SSG opened 55 telecenters (more than double the number expected) across rural Sri Lanka, serving an estimated 10,000 users, while Dialog Telecom added 100 new locations and additional services.</Description>

<Description>USAID is enhancing civilian protection of communities vulnerable to attacks by the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army (LRA) by increasing the availability of diverse communications options for use in early warning systems. Through a Cooperative Agreement with Vodacom, USAID partially supports the construction of four, low-cost base transmission stations (BTS) in target towns in Haut and Bas Uele in Province Orientale in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  Each of the four towers will provide a minimum of 315 square kilometers of cell phone connectivity to 1,200 mobile phone users living in areas previously lacking in coverage.  The increased communications options resulting from the installation of the BTS system will have both humantarian and economic benefits for the target populations.</Description>

<Description>The Madrasa (Islamic religious school) education intervention began in 2004 by the CAP Foundation, supported by USAID, as a pilot project in three madrasas in Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh).  It provided difficult to reach Muslim children access to quality formal education and skill development opportunities.  This support was offered under an IQC (BEPS) Task Order with Creative Associates.  Based on the positive results of the pilot, the program expanded in 2006 to other parts of the state in collaboration with the state government’s education department (SSA-AP).  The program works with Muslim community leaders and madrasa administrators to introduce formal curricula in madrasas, enroll and retain children, who are out of school, improve the quality of education and prepare the madrasas to meet government standards.  This involves the dual responsibility of trust-building between the state government and the madrasas and providing technical support to the madrasas.</Description>

Currently there are insufficient human and financial resources in any one institution to support a robust malaria vaccine development program.  It is only through alliances that the task can be accomplished.  Thus, for the most advanced vaccine the alliance is developing, USAID funded the development of processes to make the vaccine at WRAIR, GSK provided the adjuvant, and the vaccine is being field tested by MVI and NIH.</Description>

<Description>Pregnancy and childbirth should be a safe and positive experience for all women and provide the healthiest start for newborns. But tragically, 1,000 mothers die every day due to complications from pregnancy and childbirth. More than 3.1 million newborns die every year in the first month of life. 99% of these deaths occur in the developing world. The Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA), is a public-private partnership launched in May 2011 by Secretary of State Clinton by founding partners USAID and Johnson &amp; Johnson with supporting partners – the United Nations Foundation, mHealth Alliance and BabyCenter. MAMA founding partners are making a three-year, $10 million investment to create and strengthen programs in three countries – Bangladesh, India and South Africa – and to enhance global capability of new and existing mobile health information programs for moms in those countries and beyond. MAMA works with local organizations to send this timely and culturally sensitive health and wellness information in almost 40 countries from Afghanistan to Zambia. MAMA subscribers register for the service by indicating the expected due date, or the birthday of their recently born child, and receive weekly health messages and reminders during the pregnancy and up to the infant’s first birthday. Timed messages include tips on everything from proper nutrition, how to keep the baby warm after birth, breastfeeding, vaccinations and referrals to local health resources.</Description>

<Description>Merck and USAID/Zambia are in the process of setting up a private-public partnership in order to establish a Management and Leadership Academy (MLA) that will offer training in management and leadership to public health sector managers and providers. Management and leadership skills of managers and health providers are critical for efficient delivery of health services.  Merck has provided $4 million to BroadReach Institute for Training and Education (BRITE) who are working with the USAID-funded Zambia Integrated Systems Strengthening Program (ZISSP) to establish the MLA.  USAID, through ZISSP, will match the amount put forward by Merck and the program will be implemented from 2011 to 2014.   So far, the MLA curriculum has been developed and is being reviewed by stakeholders including the Ministry of Health.  BRITE expects to commence training of the first cohort of public health sector staff in late June 2011.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Market Led Rural Diversification Program</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The purpose of the Agreement with AGEXPORT is to provide financial support for the following areas of activities: the establishment of a Business Development Unit to broker deals between buyers and producers;  a Business Alliance Unit (BAU) that will support alliances with private businesses and assist local small- and medium-sized producers to meet the high standards for quality, volume, timely delivery, and phyto-sanitary conditions demanded by international buyers (It will also support alliances with the supermarket chains and wholesale intermediaries so that small- and medium-scale producers may obtain long-term purchase contracts; a network of Electronic Business Development Centers (EBDCs), which will be funded by additional resources to support investment and trade opportunities as well as government decentralization, and social and educational opportunities for rural communities; and Business Development Services - Global Development Alliances.  Overall, 53 alliances were subscribed with a vast diversity of partners: small producers’ organizations, big productive organizations, private exporting companies, and trade promoting fairs and shows; searching in all areas to provide demand-driven business development services to help small and medium farmers and rural enterprises improve competitiveness and tap new markets through diversification activities within the agriculture sector and into non-agricultural areas such as eco-tourism, aquaculture, crafts and services.  In general, the Alliances program helped their partners generate more than $80 million in local and international sales and exports through the establishment of new sales contracts between small rural producers with export companies; through participation in trade shows and missions in countries such as the US, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico; or nationally in activities like Agritrade, Manufexport and Expomueble and their match-making meetings and exposition floors.  Also, the program collaborated in the generation of 85,000 jobs in rural and urban areas of the country, both in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.  As leverage and partners’ contributions the program incorporated more than $ 3 million in the Alliances component alone.  Remarkable results can be mentioned in the support of small producers organizations that achieved market results, such as new sales contracts, market and products certifications, implementation of new production technologies, species and varieties.  Organizations like Labradores Mayas (Paraxaj), Horticultores de Chirijuyú, ASUDI, small berries producers from Chimaltenango, FASAGUA, CORDISA, Tikonel and Nativos, were incorporated into new markets and productive chains, going through different qualification processes to obtain the standards to be accepted.  Chirijuyú producers are selling their lettuce to Mc Donald&apos;s Guatemala, CORDISA and ASUDI are selling their pineapple to Alimentos Montesol, EMRIGOSAI is selling their asparagus to SIESA, Kiej de los Bosques is selling Tikonel (Sacalá) and Nativos (Ajpatnar Chortí) wooden and fibers products to CEMACO, Kalea stores and San Martin&apos;s bakeries.  Planessa is now exporting its own and small producers Kiowa berries.  The Sustainable Tourism Commission - COMITURS of AGEXPRONT was created and supported in order to develop productive diversification activities towards tourism in such products like the Coffee Route or other non-traditional destinations and tours, like farms, eco-hotels, diving, cruises, lakes, rivers, etc.  Also In the tourism sector, through an alliance with Fundesa, 4 entrepreneurial centers were established in Cobán, Flores, Antigua and Livingston, in which the local businessmen related to tourism created packages amongst hotels, restaurants, small rides, transport services, and others, and between the 4 regions as well.  Throughout, they launched their Guatepass product, a series of tourist routes established between</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>MARKETS Sorghum Alliance Supply Enhancement Project (MSASEP)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>USAID and Nigerian Breweries are improving sorghum production in Northern Nigeria. The goal of the sorghum is to improve the competitiveness of sorghum producers, thereby increasing the income of local farmers. This will be accomplished through strengthening village-level producer associations and credit groups. As a result of adopting demand-led production technologies, project-assisted farmers will increase their sales of value-added sorghum, increasing their cash flow and net incomes. The goal of the MARKETS Sorghum Alliance Supply Enhancement  Project is to enhance the competitiveness of Nigerian sorghum producers thereby enhancing the income of small, medium, and large-scale farmers in Nigeria. By the end of the Project, MSASEP will endeavor to meet the following objectives:  1. Village-level producer associations and credit groups provide services and financing that enhance the ability of members to market increasing amounts of quality sorghum.  2. Private dealers supply inputs to sorghum producers through market mechanisms.  3. Project-assisted farmers increase the sale of sorghum recognized in the marketplace for its quality as a result of adopting market-linked, sustainable production technology.    Primary activities include:  1. Identifying farmer groups in consultation with local extension services (ADP and NGOs);  2. Identifying and training local input providers;  3. Facilitating the purchase of inputs (seed, fertilizer etc) by other farmer groups;  4. Linking farmers with commercial banks for possible credit facilities;  5. Introducing crop yield improvement packages (POP);  6. Conducting training in quality control and cooperative marketing;  7. Introducing post-harvest techniques;  8. Facilitating negotiations with sorghum buyers/traders (maltsters);  9. Facilitating/monitoring payments for commodities.  Nigerian Breweries will contribute $550,000 to the project. Nigerian Breweries understands and accepts that, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by USAID, the funds so contributed will be received, maintained, managed, obligated and expended in accordance with USAID legal, policy and procedural requirements. Nigerian Breweries’ contribution shall be subject to availability of funds for this purpose.    USAID/Nigeria will:  1. Contribute $550,000 to the project  2.

<Description>The Merrygold Health Network Alliance (2007-2010), a USAID partnership with Hindustan Latex Family Promotion Trust (HLFPPT), launched the Merrygold Health Network, a franchise of hospitals and clinics providing maternal and child healthcare in rural communities to the underprivileged throughout Uttar Pradesh. As the franchisor, HLFPPT selected, appointed, and managed potential franchisers, seeking entrepreneurs looking to invest in hospitals and clinics and providing them with support to access finance capital and start up their own facilities. Then it granted them access to the Merrygold brand on the condition that they uphold quality standard criteria. The network aimed to provide quality care at approximately half the price of other private sector providers, and provided services free of charge to their poorest clients. Merrygold was expected to become a sustainable social enterprise and financially self-sustaining after the first three years. The alliance planned to eventually expand to 70 hospitals, 700 clinics, and 10,000 community partners, reaching approximately 8 million women.</Description>

<Description>The objectives of this alliance are: to build alliances with the private sector for the sustainable management of the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) and to improve the sustainable use and management of the MAR through the introduction of best practices in agriculture, tourism and fisheries.  This alliance will support and facilitate partnerships among NGOs, small producers and the private sector (cruise ship companies, tour operators, and agro export companies).  These partnerships will adopt and financially support the sustainable management.  The results achieved in FY 2005 include the following areas.  Watershed Management:  Watersheds that discharge along the Mesoamerican Coral Reef have been defined and a hydrological model has been selected.  The World Resources Institute started a pilot project in collaboration with Belize Coastal Zone Management office.  A second round of toxic bioaccumulation testing on marine organisms was completed.  Sustainable Fisheries: Marine best management practices for lobster and finfish based on ecosystem management were completed.  Pilot sites to monitor fisheries have been selected using established criteria.  Tourism: A steering committee to address tourism best management practices was established.  The Summit Foundation awarded U.S. $20,000 to support this component.  Scuba Diving Magazine gave an award to the ICRAN/Mesoamerican Coral Reef Alliance for develop best management practices for divers.  The standards for divers are now in their third generation, and ICRAN will start testing them.</Description>

<Description>The strategic objective of this partnership project is to achieve an improved ecological status of Mt. Mulanje and community livelihood base by introducing more intensive and diversified natural resource utilization opportunities to neighbouring communities and also increase local involvement in mountain management activities. USAID has provided funding to Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT) to implement the MOBI+LISE Project under the Development Grants Program (DGP) for a period of three years starting January 4, 2010. The total estimated cost of the project is US$3,000,000 of which MMCT with its partners will contribute US$74,950.    The  MOBI+LISE thrusts to create alternatives for livelihoods of communities living close to and do interact with the Mulanje Mountain Global Biosphere Reserve so that they would get engaged in collaborative management arrangements, increased food security, sustainable mountain resource use, and alternative livelihood opportunities and local policing.     This approach is in tandem with the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) that aims at creating wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means of achieving poverty reduction. This enlightened approach requires a concerted supportive process and expansion to realize the possible ecological management and biodiversity conservation goals, and exploit the resource potential on a sustainable basis.</Description>

The Mozambique Enterprise and Economic Empowerment Alliance (MEEEA) seeks to ensure that local communities within the GLTP benefit from the regional initiative by consolidating community rights to participate in biodiversity conservation, build community assets, and boost community income-generating capacity through partnerships with the state and the private sector.  Ultimately, the objective of the MEEEA is to establish a Mozambican model for community and private sector partnerships for natural resource management and enterprise development that may be replicated in other areas.</Description>

<Description>The Namibian Education Technology Alliance (NETA) (2001-2005), a USAID partnership with Namibia’s Ministry of Education, Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership, SchoolNet, World Teach, Peace Corps, and Microsoft, implemented by the American Federation of Teachers Education Foundation (AFTEF), developed and pilot-tested culturally and academically relevant instructional software for use in thirteen Namibian upper-primary schools (grades 5-7) in Mathematics, Science, and English. Computer-based education has helped compensate for the loss of teachers to AIDS by increasing teachers’ efficiency and effectiveness in the classroom. Under NETA, 300 teachers were trained in basic computing, and an additional 20 teachers also received advanced training on the use of the software to access computerized textbooks, generate workbooks, create tests, and use the computers to manage day-to-day class work. Within NETA, the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership Learning Center in Namibia (2004-2005), provided training and monitoring support to 18 Learning Centers in Namibia (12 of which are USAID/MultiChoice sponsored sites), as well as strengthened relationships with partners and key educational players. Teachers at schools with computer and TV/VCR technology learned to integrate the two, and reported that these complementary technologies facilitate teaching and learning. Additionally, schools began self-sufficiently generating funding by allowing parents and community members to use the TVs and VCRs for a fee.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>National Federation of Ecuadorians with Physical Disabilities and World Council of Credit Unions Telecenter Partnership</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>USAID partnered with the National Federation of Ecuadorians with Physical Disabilities (FENEDIF) and the World Council of Credit Unions to present a proposal to Microsoft&apos;s Unlimited Potential Grant Program.  This partnership complements an on-going initiative to establish telecenters accessible for persons with disabilities. The telecenters will offer access to information and training to improve IT skills, labor profile and thereby improve living standards and social inclusion. An estimated 1.6 million people (12-14%) suffer form some sort of disability in Ecuador.  Poverty, social and architectural barriers, lack of resources, training and education, high level of unemployment, continue being barriers that persons with disabilities must overcome.      At the end of 2005 the U.S. Department of State and USAID requested applications from developing countries for programs to address the needs and protect the rights of persons with disabilities (PWD).  FENEDIF, representing five key national federations presented a project to promote and protect the political and labor rights of PWD in Ecuador.  It was one of the 70 applications approved and one of the two selected Latin American countries.    To complement this initiative, FENEDIF received a donation of $105,000 ($30,000 in cash and $75,000 in software) from the Unlimited Potential Grants program of Microsoft to establish telecenters accessible to persons with disabilities. The main goal of this project is to promote inclusive development and provide employment/learning tools to PWD, through training and access to technology.    This grant seeks to 1) equip 5 rural telecenters with the appropriate technology for PWD; and 2) train PWD to use information technology as a productive, learning, and employment tool.     This project complements USAID’s on-going program “Last Mile Initiative”, implemented by the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), to expand the access of rural communities to modern communications by equipping rural telecenters.      In April 2007, FENEDIF, WOCCU, Microsoft and USAID signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate in the implementation of this grant.</Description>

<Description>The Networking Academy Alliance (2004-2008), a USAID partnership with Cisco Learning Institute, Cisco Systems, HP, International Telecommunications Union, Panduit, and UNDP, aimed to teach students computer networking skills and grant them internationally-recognized Cisco Certified Network Associate credentials, enabling trainees to compete effectively in the global marketplace. The alliance also provided girls and women scholarships to attend the Networking Academies, and offered job searching guidelines to Academy graduates. The project established 239 academies in 60 African, Asia, and Middle Eastern countries, trained 700 Cisco instructors, and trained 10,000 students, with about 30% female participation. Additionally, Cisco helped accomplish locally defined measures of success by providing academies with financial sustainability, workforce development, and gender mainstream training manuals. In Afghanistan (2004-2008), the partnership worked to expand the curriculum of Afghan universities to include “Internet Essentials”, expand Cisco Networking Academies to four or more additional cities, and additional outreach to target groups. Consequently, Internet Essentials were introduced to most of the academy programs, academies were established in Herat, Mazar, Khost, and Jalalabad, and the Afghan Women In Technology program launched with more than 700 enrolled to design a network for the Women’s Dorm. Total project investment reached $2,287,000, with USAID investment reaching $1,337,000 and partner investment reaching $300,000 in cash and $650,000 in-kind.</Description>

The purpose of the activity is to provide technical assistance to selected countries in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean Countries (OECS) to improve the variety and volume of agricultural specialty crops--e.g. pumpkins, plantains, eddoes, red tannias, cut flowers, to name a few--for exports to markets in North America and the European Union, with spin-offs inter-regionally, as well.  The approach for execution of the project is to utilize market-driven opportunities for specialty produce in the US and to promote contract farming, tied to risk management mitigation techniques in the agricultural sector in the Caribbean.  The North-South Institute is an alliance that already existed--USAID is contributing to this alliance.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>NRECA -- National Rural Electrification Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The object of the program with NRECA is to bring reliable and affordable electricity to rural and peri-urban areas, consistent with the Dominican national rural electrification plan, to increase standards of living, create economic opportunities and enhance competitiveness by increasing productivity. The ultimate goal is to provide reliable and affordable energy to the approximately 50% of the Dominican population who now have little or no access to electricity. Results for 2006 are many. Thru Sept 2006, 5,000 electricity consumer connections were implemented. Materials were procured and designed finished for the first stage of construction for the Fronteriza project, which will ultimately provide improved or new electrical connections to 6,000 consumers. Construction begins in December 2006. NRECA will connect 3,000 new users by May 30, 2007. In FY06, NRECA formed a total of 13 new rural electrification partnerships with private power sector companies, other donors, NGOs, electric and savings &amp; loans cooperatives, universities, community groups and government organizations. To date 27 partnerships have been formed. Given these advances, the cumulative target of 15 rural electric partnerships has been exceeded. During FY06 USAID, through NRECA, began training institutional energy-saving committees (called CIURE in Spanish), 127 of which were established in 40 governmental institutions. NRECA and CNE conducted three workshops to orient these committees and monitored the results. The CIURE for the Banco Central reported identifying and implementing measures that reduced their total energy bill (including use of diesel fuel as well as electricity) by 18%. NRECA and CNE staff carried out 15 detailed energy audits of government installations of many types, including a hospital, a jail, large office buildings, and a CAASD water pumping station. Results showed surprisingly uniform potential energy savings in each installation of approximately 20%, with paybacks of less than one year. The results also highlight the importance of efficiency in water pumping, which accounts for 37% of public institution energy consumption. The evaluation of the CAASD pumping plant showed a potential for 23% energy savings with a four-month payback resulting from rightsizing and retrofitting of high efficiency electric motors. USAID/DR is negotiating with NRECA for a follow-on agreement to complete the Fronteriza project.</Description>

<Description>The program seeks to reduce the digital divide and facilitate access to the world especially in rural schools and indigenous communities that do not have the capacity to access Internet services and basic communication. Oportunet is a project implemented by the Paraguayan Foundation with funds from USAID. 100 rural and remote populations of Paraguay were selected to receive free Internet access for 2 years. The objective of the project is to provide telecommunications access to rural areas that are practically disconnected from the rest of the country and the world because of the lack of technology (telephone or Internet) or due to the high cost of existing ones. This access is a primordial requirement for the economic, educational, and social development of the country. In addition to providing the connection, the project trains the beneficiaries, helps with content and software development, and promotes the creation of local content and establishing cooperation networks among the members.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Out of School Youth: IDDI and Barrick Gold Mine</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This project seeks to reintegrate into productive and educational activities 400 adolescents and youths between the ages of 13 and 21 who have abandoned their public schooling.  Vocational training in the towns of Cotui and Maimon, in the central part of the Dominican Republic, will be provided to them.  The model uses an assets-based development approach uncovering hidden skill and talent already present in the community and youth, and then adds value.  Our technical approach effectively makes use of the assets that each stakeholder offers in this project.  These assets may be summarized as follows: As to participating adolescents and youths, the major asset they bring to the table is their ability to “sobrevivir y echar pa’lante” (survive and keep moving forward), despite being immersed in situations dominated by marginalization, delinquency, drugs, commercial sexual exploitation and inter-family conflict.  Despite their limited academic formation (as a result of a boring, non attentive, and frequently inaccessible school system), their hunger to succeed more than compensates for any learning shortcomings.  The Barrick Gold Corporation has shown a proven commitment to corporate social responsibility and a desire to incorporate traditionally marginalized groups in the economic benefits of their investment in the Pueblo Viejo mine.  This is supported by significant cash and in-kind contributions plus an active involvement in the project by key corporate staff.  A successful history of resource linkage between development projects and the corporate sector in the Dominican Republic with a track record of community ownership and empowerment in communities is traditionally dependent on paternalism.  IDDI has also demonstrated innovative approaches in youth development, micro-enterprise, and gender equality.  The ability to apply accelerated learning techniques through Quantum Learning in the Dominican Republic demonstrates that out-of-school children and youths can rediscover their learning potential, regain lost years of school, and develop self sufficient, “learning how to learn” and life skills that create a platform for eventual employability or entrepreneurship.   ITECO has shown its experience and knowledge in vocational and ICT training at the local level in Cotui and Maimon , as well as providing local facilities, equipment, and staff for this project.  These five assets are fundamental for the success of the project.  The technical premises for this project are simple.  There will be an economic boom in the area, due to the Barrick investment.  We want to make sure that a traditionally marginalized sector–-out of school adolescents and youths-–can benefit from this impact.  To achieve this, they need to upgrade their knowledge and skills and become more “employable,” thus being able to take advantage of independent economic opportunities created as a result of Barrick’s investment.  If they do not do this, they will be left by the wayside.  One of the challenges is the limited capacity of youth due to lost time and lack of progress made in the public education system.  Since they are so far behind to begin with, we need to accelerate their acquisition of knowledge and skills.  Therefore, we need to create a unique learning and training process in a relatively short period of time that both allows them to access an initial foothold in the economic growth and creates a sustainable anchor for them to continue schooling and expand their economic growth.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Outreach Centers</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objective is to provide a convening place in an at-risk-community, most likely a community with gang activity, where vulnerable youth can learn different skills, make a positive use of their time, be referred to a jobs or training opportunities, and/or have access to counseling services.      The Outreach Centers are a methodology of crime prevention developed by the Regional Youth Alliance Project- AJR (USAID –SICA) implemented by Creative AssociatesInternational. An OC is the product of alliances being created with a faith based organization (church) or an NGO with local presence, the community (neighbors), the Municipality, private organizations with the financial and technical support from AJR. These associations allow the design and initiative implementations in favor of vulnerable youth so that opportunities are given and the environment of violence is changed for a more peaceful one.    Creative works in 3 different countries: El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. There are 25 OCs which are working right now (5 in ES, 3 in Honduras and 17 in Guatemala) and 36 more that are expected to be opened in the next 18 months.     An OC has basically 5 components:    1) Creative use of leisure time, either in an artistic way or by doing sports. Youth has a lot of free time and there is where their risk of gang recruitment is higher if they spend their time just on the streets.  2) Job training. OCs offer the possibility of learning new job tasks and develop useful skills for work. For example: computer learning, English, coking, electricity, etc.  3) School reinforcement. This is about supporting community kids and youth so they can make their homework at the OC so they can maintain or improve their performance at school.  4) Opportunities management. It consists of helping find a job or any opportunity like scholarship to all the possible youth so they can become an example to other vulnerable kids.  5) Volunteering. OC seeks the involvement of all the community in such a way that all the neighbors interested in collaborating can offer their time to help others in the community and thus reducing costs for the maintenance of the OC.</Description>

The Department of Agriculture, through its Agribusiness Marketing Assistance Services, co-funded selected Mindanao Exhibitors’ cost of participation to the Hong Kong Food Expo (19th International Exhibition) to enable Mindanao food suppliers to develop and expand business networks with potential buyers.     As a result of direct marketing and promotion activities to over 371 food suppliers and potential buyers who attended the Expo, a grand total of US$3,892,985 (837,993MT) of actual sales, booked orders, and sales under negotiation were generated. These figures will translate into increased demand for raw materials benefiting small landholders in Mindanao who will be provided with the opportunity to venture into contract growership or other supply arrangements with these export companies to meet export market requirement.     The partnership with DA entails cost sharing on expenses incurred for travel, lodging, land transportation, and booth space rental on the part of the exhibitors.</Description>

<Description>The objective is to improve government capacity to implement the National Policy to Combat Chronic Malnutrition among Children, with the participation of the private sector and civil society. The Partnership for Child Nutrition (the Partnership) aims to improve the nutritional status of young children in eight districts in the Ancash and Huancavelica regions by: (i) keeping the fight against child malnutrition on the public agenda, (ii) increasing efforts by local providers to reduce chronic malnutrition, (iii) increasing investments from government and private sector to address the problem, and (iv) increasing community action to reduce hunger and malnutrition in young children, monitor the situation and hold accountable public health authorities. The Partnership is formed by PRISMA, ADRA, CARE, and CARITAS. These organizations work together to strengthen the capacity of the two regional (Ancash and Huancavelica) and eight local governments to implement the national strategy to reduce chronic childhood malnutrition.  They will equip these public authorities with public management tools to plan and deliver services that will reduce CCM; they will provide training and build capacity building opportunities to health workers to ensure the adequate supply of basic services; and they will work with community members and civil society organizations to actively participate in decision-making, citizen surveillance and accountability activities. The Partnership will leverage resources from the Antamina and Buenaventura mining companies, Radio Programas del Peru (RPP), PRAGMA (a publicity company), and the regional governments of Huancavelica and Ancash to support the Partnership for Child Nutrition. The Partnership works closely with local governments as well as with the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS).</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Partnership for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>PCIA was launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 to address the increased environmental health risk faced by 3 billion people who burn solid fuels in open fires and rudimentary, unvented stoves for cooking and heating. This voluntary Partnership brings together governments, public and private organizations, multilateral institutions, industry, and others to increase the use of affordable, reliable, clean, efficient, and safe cooking technologies and fuels. Some three billion people worldwide burn traditional biomass (e.g., wood, dung, crop residues) and coal indoors for home cooking and heating. The International Energy Agency estimates that 200 million more people will use these fuels by 2030. According to the World Health Organization, this widespread use results in the premature deaths of an estimated 1.5 million people each year from breathing elevated levels of indoor smoke, with women and children being most significantly affected. Indoor air pollution from household energy is the fourth ranked health risk in poor developing countries, after malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water. Breathing elevated levels of indoor smoke from home cooking and heating practices more than doubles a child&apos;s risk of serious respiratory infection and may also be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., stillbirth and low-weight babies). More than 290 public and private organizations have joined the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air to contribute their resources and expertise to improve health, livelihood, and quality of life by reducing exposure to indoor air pollution, primarily among women and children. The Partnership focuses on four priority areas which have proved to be essential elements for sustainable household energy and health programs in developing countries: - Meeting Social and Behavioral Needs - Developing Local Markets - Improving Technology Design &amp; Performance - Monitoring Impacts of Interventions. Already, key PCIA Partners have reported helping 2.4 million households to adopt clean cooking and heating practices, reducing harmful exposures for more than 18.4 million people. By 2011, Partners plan to reach another 26 million households. As more PCIA Partners establish goals and report progress, these results will grow. In addition to the significant health benefits, improved cooking technologies and fuels have social, economic, and environmental benefits.  Women and children spend less time collecting fuel, allowing more time for important educational and economic activities.  Clean burning and fuel efficient cooking practices also reduce carbon emissions, deforestation, erosion, and desertification caused by burning solid fuels.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Partnership for Road Safety Foundation</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The goal of the Partnership is to reduce crashes on Georgia roads and support elaboration of the national road safety strategy. Intervention I: Increase the Use of Seat Belts:  The Alliance aims to change the attitude and subsequently a behaviour of drivers and passengers by increasing the awareness on the role of seat belts in preserving the human life and reducing road traffic injuries. The project target is to increase the use of seat belts in Georgia at least to 25% on urban roads and 50% on the highways by 2010. The international experience shows that initial focus on seat belt campaign, rather than several different areas of road safety education, is vital in order to achieve some tangible outcomes and build a foundation for tackling other aspects of road safety. It is obvious that road traffic participants which went through change and started wearing seat belts are much more perceptive to other problems and eager to adopt new behaviour patterns.    Intervention II: Youth road safety education:  The Alliance aims to introduce road safety education to the national curriculum through piloting the module at 48 schools in 6 towns of Georgia. The project will contribute towards achievement of National Goals in Education and through awareness raising address the increasing public health concern related to road safety. The Ministry has approved the project and recommended it to be piloted in the selected schools. Youth road safety education will produce a positive impact on prevention of injuries and fatalities among children and youth. International practice shows that as a preventive measure the majority of countries adopt road safety education in schools, which increases the knowledge of children from early age and positively affects their behaviour in the capacity of road traffic participants. The goal of the “Georgia Alliance for Safe Roads” is to improve the health and lives of women, children and men in Georgia by decreasing traffic related injuries and fatalities.</Description>

<Description>Organon Pharmaceutical Company is working with USAID’s ZdravPlus project to provide oral contraceptives for the ZdravPlus pilot sites in support of ZdravPlus’ family planning activities.  

One of the goals of the USAID ZdravPlus II project in Kazakhstan is to improve the reproductive health of the population through the increased use of family planning methods and reduction of abortion rates.  ZdravPlus developed a core training course in family planning counseling of health providers and has implemented the course in pilot sites in Zhezkazgan, Satpaev, Almaty, and Astana.  ZdravPlus II trains primary health care (PHC) and hospital-level providers in family planning and the counseling of post-partum and post-abortion women.  The project links this training with the provision of contraceptives at PHC facilities and maternity hospitals.  The target population at the ZdravPlus pilot sites will continue to receive contraceptive methods after the courses are finished.  The estimated cost of the donated contraceptives is $627,000.</Description>

<Description>The Object of this activity was the fostering of inter-ethnic cooperation and reconciliation especially among youth, which is a key USAID objective in Kosovo.  Since Kosovo&apos;s declaration of independence in February 2008, finding ways of bringing young Serbs and Albanians together has been a greater challenge.  In summer 2008, contributions from USAID and NIKE were used to run multi-ethnic sports camps in Kosovo.  The camps, which were attended by 450 youths, included training in both sports and conflict resolution/peace building.  This was a one-time activity.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>President&apos;s Malaria Initiative (PMI) Angola</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>Angola is one of three first-round target countries to benefit from the President&apos;s Malaria Initiative (PMI), a five-year, $1.2 billion program led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the Department of State, and the White House.

The specific goal of the PMI is to reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent, by reaching 85 percent of the most vulnerable groups - mainly children under five years of age, pregnant women, and persons living with HIV/AIDS - with lifesaving services, supplies and medicines.

The PMI coordinates with national malaria control programs and international partners, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the World Bank Malaria Booster Program; the Roll Back Malaria partnership; nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based and community groups; and the private sector. 

In support of Angola&apos;s national malaria control program, the PMI backs five key intervention strategies to prevent and treat malaria: spraying with insecticides (“indoor residual spraying”); insecticide-treated mosquito nets; intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women; lifesaving drugs; and diagnosis and treatment.</Description>

The alliance is channeling private sector resources, energy and capabilities to: reinforce Angolan efforts to deliver AIDS prevention and behavior change messages to employees, their families and communities; provide a forum for companies to share their HIV/AIDS related experiences and materials, such as workplace policies, insurance plans, and awareness and prevention programs; link experienced companies with other companies seeking suggestions on how to start or how to improve their HIV/AIDS outreach, education and care programs; improve communication and feedback between the private sector and the National Institute for the Fight Against AIDS on policies, best practices, and strategic thinking on mitigating the effect of HIV/AIDS on the labor force and in Angolan communities in general. The Private Sector Alliance Against HIV/AIDS aims to: share experiences relating to the activities of each program; participate in external campaigns fostered by the Alliance; promote incentive and support to companies in the development of their programs to fight HIV/AIDS; promote updating courses on the theme based on the experiences of each member company; and establish common themes for internal campaigns.

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Private Sector Managed Health Insurance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Health Insurance Fund (HIF) is a foundation, based in the Netherlands, which provides private health insurance to low income African workers, and in Tanzania operates through the local Strategis Insurance Company, with technical support from PharmAccess International, a non-profit Dutch NGO involved HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in Tanzania. The HIF will target 2,000 registered worker households at the Kivukoni Fish Market in Dar es Salaam, 11,000 PRIDE micro-loan client households in Dar es Salaam, and 44,000 Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union organic coffee farm families in Arusha. 

The HIF subsidizes premiums so that low-income workers can assess clinics that provide the best care. Provision of premium subsidies through the HIF will directly impact on impact on the ability of low-income families to access quality health care. In the long-term the program will increase revenue to quality health providers through greater volumes of patients, which in turn will lower costs/patient and will attract more people to the insurance scheme. As the number of people contribute to risk pool fund, the subsidy element will be reduced and offset by profit-making through premiums paid by higher-income and healthier insurance members. It is anticipated that private health insurers and government schemes will take over, at least, part of the program.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Pro-bono Legal Work Framework</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This public-private partnership provides pro-bono legal services to non-governmental, non-profit organizations in Russia.  It was established to support a “pro bono clearinghouse” created by the American Bar Association and the Public Interest Law Institute under a USAID program.  The clearinghouse helps NGOs in need of legal advice and representation to secure pro bono services from law firms and corporate legal departments in Russia.  In order to encourage the concept of pro bono legal aid, and to improve the effectiveness of the services provided, the clearinghouse also trains corporate lawyers on legal issues affecting NGOs (such as NGO taxation, registration and reporting under the revised NGO law, employment contracts, leases, the tax liability for recipients of NGO services, etc.)  
About twenty international and Russian legal firms and corporations have agreed to participate in the clearinghouse database and to provide pro bono services to NGOs.  As of August 2008, 51 NGOs had applied for pro bono assistance and 41 of the legal matters circulated through the clearinghouse database were placed with a firm.  The most prevalent need for support is in the area of NGO registration; other common requests regard contracts, taxation, legal research, and lease/property issues.  The organizations that have received assistance so far include public interest and social service organizations, groups assisting children and the elderly, NGO resource centers, and educational NGOs.  A conference on pro bono law was held in Moscow for representatives of law firms, bar associations, and NGOs.  Among the topics discussed was the U.S. experience integrating pro bono practice into the culture of law firms.  Lawyers from the clearinghouse’s participating firms and corporations were also trained on a variety of legal issues that are particularly relevant to the NGO context.  The partnership’s private sector partners include: Allen &amp; Overy Legal Services; Baker &amp; McKenzie; Baker Botts LLP; Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP; Charities Aid Foundation; Citi Russia; Clifford Chance CIS Ltd; Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP; Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP; DLA Piper; Freshfields’ Bruckhaus Deringer; Hogan &amp; Hartson LLP; Jones Day; Latham &amp; Watkins LLP; Mayol LLC; Nestle Russia; Norman DL Associates; Olevinskiy, Buyukan &amp; Partners; Orrick (CIS) LLC; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP; White &amp; Case LLC.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Project Peanut Butter</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This partnership will support the establishment of a global development alliance between USAID, Project Peanut Butter, Nutriset, Hickey Family Foundation and ARNOW. The purpose is to increase and strengthen the local production facility in Malawi. The scaled-up PPB facility will be able to produce a greater quantity of RUTF for home-based treatment of malnourished children and a ready -to-use supplement for adults and children infected with HIV and receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Malawi has one of the highest levels of child malnutrition. The Malawi Government Nutrition Policy and Strategy has defined high-impact nutrition interventions, focussing on both prevention and treatment of nutrition disorders.     Management of severe acute malnutrition is done in therapeutic feeding programs. Traditional approaches to treating acute malnutrition have relied on in-patient, hospital-based care, which has resulted in caregivers staying away from home to take care of the child in the hospital. Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) has been a major advance in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition, in that it has made it possible to treat acute malnutrition in the community, with high recovery rates.    Having noted the success of pilot community therapeutic care (CTC) projects in a few sites, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2006 adopted the CTC approach as a preferred method for treating severe acute malnutrition. The CTC program has been enhanced by Malawi&apos;s ability to manufacture RUTFlocally, the demand for which is high, and is likely to increase as more children with acute malnutrition are being identified. MOH also uses RUTF in its nutrition care, treatment and support programs for people living with HIV and AIDS. It is estimated that 20% of patients starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) each year are eligible for therapeutic or supplementary feeding programs.    Project Peanut Butter is one of the two manufacturers of RUTF in Malawi, with a good performance record and certified in 2006 by UNICEF. Through this program, PPB will increase the production of RUTF from the current level of 500 to 1,200 MT per year, while maintaining the highest standards in the production. This rate of production will support projects working to feed an estimated 30,000 children that are severely malnourished, and produce enough ready-to-use foods to provide nutritional support to an estimated 51,000 adults and other children that are nutritionally - vulnerable and malnourished. The new recipes would use less milk, which is the most expensive ingredient.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Promote Normative Change and Increase Prevention Behavior in Malawi</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Johns Hopkins University CCP Bridge II Project seeks to strengthen individual perception of HIV risk and self efficacy to prevent HIV infection, by supporting workplace interventions that target workers in workplaces and the communities surrounding agricultural estates and other large employers through linking USG-supported prevention programs with these populations and improving the technical quality of privately-supported prevention programming. Bridge II project focusses on reducing new infections among adults in the general population. The project provides technical support to help ensure the prevention programming provided by private sector companies such as agricultural estates is in keeping with best practices, and helps to link these private sector programs with other available HIV interventions. While some businesses are already implementing comprehensive HIV programs, others have not yet started. The project, therefore, conducts an informal survey of large workplaces to learn what activities are being undertaken. Data collected is triaged, and based on this businesses are sub-divided by level of program depth, quality, and interest. The project then collaborates with companies to complement programs that need strengthening, build programs where there is active interest, and advocate with those that are resistant.     Bridge II trains existing workplace peer educators to use BRIDGE tools. The project advocates with leadership in these workplaces to support BCC interventions. The project also helps leadership to draw up action plans for the proposed interventions. BRIDGE II Team has developed a fact sheet that was used as an advocacy tool during these meetings.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Promoting Pro-bono Legal Services to NGOs</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>USAID/Russia, American Bar Association-Rule Of Law Initiative (ABA/ROLI), and the Public Interest Law Institute (PILI) agreed to cooperate in establishing a Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse that coordinates the work of private sector law firms providing free legal services for individuals and NGOs that can’t otherwise afford legal services. USAID/Russia, ABA-ROLI and PILI agreed that USAID/Russia would provide funding for the establishment of a Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse.  White &amp; Case has contributed $10,000 to PILI to support the establishment of the clearinghouse and the rest of the collaboration will take the form of “in kind” donations from law firms providing legal services    The Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse is similar to one that was launched by PILI in Hungary in 2006 and which has already achieved impressive results and remarkable impact. The goal of the Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse is to introduce NGOs and individuals operating in Russia to lawyers who are willing and able to provide advice on legal matters free of charge.  Members of PILI&apos;s Moscow staff have good knowledge of local law firms and NGOs, which will help PILI to &quot;negotiate&quot; between the different needs, approaches and cultures of each group.    Several law firms and NGOs operating in Moscow have indicated that they are willing to participate in the Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse.  When an NGO or individual informs PILI of a legal matter on which it would like assistance, PILI contacts the law firms offering them an opportunity to provide advice on the matter.  PILI then introduces the law firm selected to the NGO or individual and assists in ensuring a smooth collaboration between the two entities.    It is anticipated that most legal matters processed through the Russian Pro Bono Clearinghouse will involve one or more of the following:  • Formation and operation of a legal entity (not-for-profit);  • Registration;  • Taxation;  • Employment;  • Intellectual Property;  • Contracts;  • Real Estate; and  • Dispute Resolution.</Description>

<Description>The objective of this alliance is to reduce the impact of malaria in Sub Saharan Africa.  Results achieved include: shortages of ITNs dramatically reduced; sales of ITNs nearly doubled; access to ITNs expanded; more vulnerable populations reached through rural distribution of ITNs; and strengthened sustainability of the commercial ITN market.  Voucher system to target the most vulnerable populations with targeted subsidies for purchase of ITNs was successfully implanted in 6 districts and is currently being expanded to 5 regions of Senegal. Distribution of of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) in cooperation with 38 African ITN distributors, Agrimat, Anovotek, Aventis, A-Z (Tanzania), BASF, Bayer, EXP Momentum, Exxon Mobil, Rosies Textiles, Siamdutch Mosquito Netting Co., Ltd, Sunflag, Syngenta Tana Netting Vestergaard. Netmark Is an eight year, $65.4 million dollar USAID/W managed project designed to reduce the impact of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa through the increased use of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs), and insecticide treatment kits for nets, through partnership and joint investment with a wide range of international and local commercial partners. Since it’s launch in 1999 NetMark has worked with the commercial sector to identify and overcome the barriers to the creation of commercially viable markets for ITNs in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia that would lessen the burden on the public sector by creating demand and corresponding supply for those who can afford to pay.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Public Private Conservation Alliance for Protected Areas Management</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Arannyak Foundation (Bangladesh Tropical Forest Conservation Foundation) established under the U.S. Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 seeks to expand the scope and area coverage of its conservation efforts by adopting the best practices of Nishorgo Support Project&apos;s (NSP) successful co-management approach. (The NSP project is a USAID-funded environment project). NSP’s technical assistance prepared Arannyak to take on large-scale, protected area level co-management initiatives. Arannyak has approved a proposal by Bangladesh Forest Department, under the Ministry of Environment and Forest, to start co-management at the Inani Reserve Forest, which will be declared as a National Park soon. The 1+ million Bangladesh Scouts organize many events and activities each year, but have few outlets to direct their young members’ energy into practical conservation measures. Therefore, the Scouts volunteer and contribute to conservation in protected areas under the NSP. Banglalink, the Bangladeshi operation of Orascom Telecom, seeks to associate its brand with active, energetic and dynamic exploration of the natural wonders of the country. Association with the NSP for Protected Areas Management provides that opportunity. Therefore, Banglalink provides direct cash support for 10,000 copies of a Bangla/English book, &quot;Protected Area Visitor&apos;s Guide&quot;, and a variety of joint marketing items for youth events (e.g. t-shirts, hats, sound systems, etc.). Recently, Banglalink, in association with commercial tour operators has launched a nationwide campaign for responsible tourism.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Public Private Partnership for Earthquake Risk Mitigation</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This alliance aims to enhance the capacity of earthquake engineers in the public and private sectors to better address the issue of earthquake and other risks preparedness in India.  One of the key objectives of the alliance is to transfer expertise for retrofitting lifeline buildings, such as schools, hospitals etc., and create replicable models for implementation in the country and region.  Some efforts and notable milestones include a flag-ship partnership program under USAID/India’s disaster management efforts, where the Ministry of Home Affairs (nodal agency of the Govt. of India responsible for in-country disaster management), the Govt. of Delhi, and the three Institutes of Technology, along with Geo-Hazards International, have come together to demonstrate the retrofitting of five proto-typical public utility buildings in Delhi; setting up of the Retrofit Circle, a division in the Delhi Public Works Department exclusively focused on retrofitting.  Among others, it engages in creating awareness within the state government as well as the public at large, providing information and preparing plans for additional retrofit projects.  The Circle is a major step towards ensuring the sustainability of our efforts. Already, the Circle has started working on plan preparation for demonstrative retrofitting of schools in each district of Delhi.  
Along with structural safety, non-structural safety assessments have been completed in two of the five selected buildings, a public school and a government hospital; and falling hazards in the Principal’s room in the school have been mitigated as part of a demonstration exercise.  Based on this experience, a manual on non-structural mitigation for schools has been prepared, and the Delhi govt. has printed 10,000 copies.  The government is currently planning to translate the manual into the local language for wider dissemination.  The majority of the $10 million contribution is from the government for the cost of retrofitting the five lifeline buildings selected for the project.</Description>

<Description>The PPA is a new, joint initiative among governments, companies and civil society to support supply chain solutions to conflict minerals challenges in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Great Lakes Region (GLR) of Central Africa. Leaders worldwide are calling for action to address conflict minerals concerns while delivering solutions that benefit those involved in responsible minerals trade in the Great Lakes Region.  The PPA was launched in November 2011 as a joint effort with the U.S. Department of State, USAID, non-governmental organizations and companies/industry organizations to take on the challenge of conflict minerals in the DRC.  Initial objectives include leverage $5.5 million between USAID and end-users (contributing $2 million) to support conflict-free sourcing, to provide credible information to assist all supply chain actors to make better-informed due-diligence decisions; and to improve coordinations and engagement with all stakeholders.  The PPA includes the U.S. Department of State, USAID, the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (the DRC, its nine neighboring countries, Sudan and Kenya), with a coalition of 18 prominent U.S. and international companies, three industry associations (representing 106 private sector companies) and several civil society and other organizations.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Public-Private Customs and Tax Task Force</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>USAID’s Business Climate Reform Project (BCR) has brokered and participates in an ongoing, very successful public-private partnership between American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) and the Ministry of Finance/State Revenue Service to promote customs and tax reforms.  The Task Force was requested by GOG counterparts, at the recommendation of the USAID-funded project, based on ideas from AmCham.  The Task Force, led by AmCham, reaches out to a broad spectrum of Georgian businesses and traders to identify common problems, prioritize them, and propose solutions.  Task Force members also engage closely with the Government of Georgia (GOG) counterparts to improve the legislation regulating customs and tax, and remove ambiguities.  Customs and tax advisors from the Project and the EU Customs Project provide technical assistance to the Task Force to assure compliance with international best practices and Georgia’s treaty obligations.  The partnership provides the GOG with a valuable mechanism for: consulting broadly with the private sector; avoiding the appearance of impropriety by consulting too closely with large traders; eliminating unproductive time spent listening to a confusing welter of individual complaints without solutions; prioritizing problems; and adopting solutions that are supported by international practice and treaty obligations.  The Customs Working Group consists of seven customs experts, made up of representatives of the private sector (sponsored by BCR and AmCham) and SRS.  The Tax Working Group consists of tax experts from BCR, AmCham, and the Revenue Service.  To date, many recommendations to increase the transparency of Customs transactions and simplify Customs procedures and documents have been approved by the working group and adopted by the GOG.  The project continues to evaluate the ideas generated at these meetings, incorporate those that introduce good practice and benefit the larger business environment into improved services, and draft legislation to the GOG for consideration.</Description>

The flower refined extract is the main and organic raw material for private companies producing pesticides and insecticides in the world. Pyrethrum farming was introduced in Rwanda in 1937 and since 2007; Rwanda started exporting refined and concentrated pyrethrin extract. However, flower productivity and quality have been very low with a production of only 209 metric tons of dried flowers and pyrethrin level (pyrethrum content) of 0.9 in 2009. 

To address this issue,  USAID/Rwanda and S.C. Johnson, U.S.-based global manufacturer of household cleaning supplies and other consumer chemicals, partnered to help farmers increase their production, improve quality of flowers and therefore increase their income. Due to this project’s assistance, the production of dried flowers reached 610 metric tons and 1.2 pyrethrin levels by the end 2012. The production of 610 metric tons was valued at $910,000. This represents a 191 percent increase in production since the beginning of the joint USAID-private sector partnership three years ago. This joint effort will continue work to increase production and quality of pyrethrum flowers through better farming practices, but also strengthen farmer cooperative organizations and empower women farmers.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Qualcomm Wireless Reach™ Initiative (WRI) in El Salvador: Wireless Security</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>To strengthen the violence analysis and mapping capabilities of Santa Tecla’s violence observatory   through the adoption of state of the art telecommunication technology. The municipality of Santa Tecla established in 2006 a municipal observatory to monitor the violence indices in different sector of the city. In 2009, USAID, through its implementer Research Triangle Institute (RTI), provided technical assistance and some equipment.    Last year, RTI established a partnership with Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a San Diego, California-based leading developer and innovator of wireless technologies, products and services to further strengthen the observatory’s capabilities. Seguridad Inalámbrica (Wireless Security) is a new system that provides Salvadoran law enforcement and municipal government personnel with devices and applications that can assist in the development of new and more effective programs to reduce crime.   The system includes mobile- and web-based applications which communicate with each other to provide the municipality of Santa Tecla with centralized and easily accessible real-time crime mapping capabilities.  Qualcomm Incorporated, through its Wireless Reach™ initiative, has provided funding to RTI, approximately $250,000 to roll out this system.  Funding supports system design and development, training, implementation, management and monitoring and evaluation.  In close cooperation with the municipality of Santa Tecla, the Policía Nacional Civil (PNC, The National Civilian Police) and other local stakeholders, the RTI team tested a cost-effective method for reporting and mapping crime using mobile smartphones operating on local telecom company Tigo’s 3G HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) network.    Participating law enforcement agents from the Policía Nacional Civil (PNC) and the Cuerpo de Agentes Metropolitanas (CAM) have been issued 3G mobile phones equipped with a simple Java-based software application for reporting crimes.  Agents use the application to report each crime from as near as possible to the location of the crime.  Information regarding the nature and location of the crime then is immediately transmitted by the officer from the 3G handset to a web-based crime database application.    Once the data has been entered into the database, officials from Santa Tecla’s Observatory can access the data in real-time for analysis.  The system displays incidents on detailed maps, facilitates the identification of high-risk locations and helpstrack changes in crime patterns over time as law enforcement agencies crime and violence prevention programs are introduced.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>R4 Rural Resiliance Initiative Expansion</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>On September 19, 2011, USAID, Swiss Re, UN World Food Program, and Oxfam America committed to expand the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative from Ethiopia to Senegal over the next five years to help the poor protect their crops and livelihoods from the impacts of climate variability and change. R4 will enable poor farmers in Senegal to strengthen their food and income security by managing risks through a four-part approach - improving natural resource management (community risk reduction), accessing microcredit (&quot;prudent&quot; risk taking), gaining insurance coverage (risk transfer), and increasing savings (risk reserves). USAID contributed $8 million to support the expansion to Senegal and the global development of the initiative. Swiss Re supports the R4 initiative as the exclusive insurance sector partner and planned to lead the design and implementation of risk transfer solutions. These innovative solutions form part of a comprehensive risk management program that will give thousands of poor, small-holder farmers the means to manage weather vulnerability and enable the risk-taking essential to economic development.  Swiss Re will contribute $1.25 million to the initiative. R4 builds upon the highly successful growth of a multi-year pilot in Ethiopia known as the Horn of Africa Risk Transfer for Adaptation (HARITA) project, which involved a network of global and local partners including Oxfam America, Swiss Re, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Relief Society of Tigray, Dedebit Credit and Savings Institution, Nyala Insurance Company, Africa Insurance Company and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. In its three of years of delivery this pilot, HARITA, has scaled up from 200 enrolled households in one village in 2009 to over 13,000 enrolled households in 43 villages in 2011.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Reef Check</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This three-year project works to strengthen the DR economy by achieving a 10% increase in tourism revenue over three years, based on lengthier stays and increased visitor satisfaction, while also educating tourists, hoteliers and local citizens in the intricacies of the local marine environment and the value of protecting it.  The project aims to: increase employment opportunities in dive companies and resorts; increase the incentive and ability of the tourism industry to protect coral reefs through monitoring; and increase the consumer satisfaction of tourists--all while promoting the sustainability and expansion of the tourism industry.  The results for 2006 fall into three categories: Environmental Education; Design and Printing of the Reef Check Multi-level Monitoring Program; and Reef Check Trainings and Monitoring.  In collaboration with the National Aquarium of Santo Domingo, two coral exhibits were prepared to show the difference between a balanced and an unbalanced reef system.  A series of interpretive signs explained how reef systems become degraded, and potential solutions.  Four levels of a five-level monitoring program as well as the Reef Check Instruction Manual were developed and published in multiple languages.  Two posters were designed and printed locally to promote coral reef conservation and linkage to the national economy (i.e. tourism).  During 2006, Reef Check Dominican Republic (RC-DR) conducted over ten regular trainings in Punta Cana, Bayahibe, Santo Domingo, Sosua, and Punta Rusia.  These trainings have been offered free of charge to Dive Centers, governmental and non-governmental staff, and recreational divers.  A total of 34 divers were trained during 2006 in the RC protocol to monitor coral reef health.  A total of 4 lectures and presentations in coral reef biodiversity and conservation were offered.  One snorkeling trip was also conducted in Santo Domingo with college students.  During 2006 RCDR volunteers supported the national coral reef monitoring program with the survey of 15 sites around the entire island: Cabo Rojo, Bahia de las Aguilas, La Caleta, Boca Chica, Juan Dolio, Isla Catalina, Bayahibe and Parque del Este, Punta Cana, Bavaro, Samana, Rio San Juan, Sosua, Puerto Plata and Punta Rusia.  All data has been locally revised and sent to the global database in Reef Check Headquarters, which are being used to analyze local trends in reef health on an annual basis.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Revive a River in Armenia</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The objective of this partnership is to improve the environment of Dilijan through the construction of a wastewater treatment facility, repair or reconstruction of the sewage network and collectors.  After the project is completed, the Municipality of Dilijan will have a functioning wastewater treatment system.  In addition to the wastewater facility and sewage network, the project will also engage the community in environmental and cultural heritage protection activities along the river. USAID has made the preservation and environmentally sound development of the world’s water resources a top priority. USAID’s investments have helped improve access to safe and adequate water supply and sanitation, improve irrigation technology, enhance natural environments, and develop better institutional capacity for water resources management in countries around the world. USAID allocated $200,000 in resources for water supply and sanitation including financing portion of treatment plant cost and community mobilization. The Coca-Cola Corporation (TCCC) is building and nurturing the connections with the people of the world which is an essential part of the TCCC’s work. As water is the integral to Coca-Cola’s business, the Company’s ability to prosper depends on its management of this resource. To advance this project in Armenia, the TCCC contributed $150,000 that will go toward project technical design cost, installation of treatment plant, community mobilization and public outreach. UNDP is the organization advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. UNDP has committed to providing $78,500 to the Activity that would go toward technical design, project infrastructure costs and community mobilization and public outreach efforts. UNDP also is the implementing partner responsible for overall project management and subcontracting of the Activity. In parallel with this activity the Government of Armenia will provide funding to SWC for rehabilitating Dilijan’s sewerage collection network. In assessing its infrastructure needs the Municipality of Dilijan has identified water supply and distribution systems improvement and sewerage, wastewater treatment facility development and solid waste collection and disposal as its top priorities, as these will have a significant positive social impact. The works contracts undertaken by the municipality under this Activity will have a positive short-term impact on local employment in the construction industry. The provision of more reliable local infrastructure will have a positive general effect on the revival of local economic activity. The Municipality of Dilijan committed $100,000 that would go toward activity infrastructure costs. In order to improve the environmental condition of Dilijan city and fully use its economic potential the Government of Armenia committed $40,000 to UNDP that would go toward activity infrastructure costs.</Description>

<Description>The objective of this grant is to establish a Public-Private Alliance that will provide a sustainable financing mechanism in the form of two parallel Revolving Funds to improve hospital conditions at Bishkek medical facilities.  Loans from the Revolving Funds will be used to purchase and install equipment that will make patient stays more comfortable, primarily through increased and better controlled room temperatures through reduction of heat losses.  Some small infrastructure improvements (insulated windows, etc.) will also be realized to allow energy savings, and the medical facilities can use the saved funds for further improvement of infrastructure, procurement of medicines and medical equipment, and to attract and retain qualified medical staff.  USAID-funded activities will provide technical assistance and training to build local capacity and skills of Alliance partners to bring together the private sector, municipalities, non-governmental organizations, local consulting firms and international consultants to achieve the overall goals.  Revolving Fund loans will be used for the purchase and installation of equipment and materials to improve the automatic regulation of heat flows, hot water supply, and the establishment of energy use monitoring regimes for hospital operation and maintenance personnel.  These activities will be funded on a competitive basis through the local contractor firm Demo Zone as an extension of its current revolving fund activities in other areas.</Description>

<Description>To create a sustainable top-quality soft fruit sector in BiH, USAID partnered with Microcredit Foundation Partner (MKF Partner) to implement the Rural Employment Generation Activity (REGA) Project, which focused on providing berry fruit producers throughout the country with access to finance and technical assistance, and linked small berry farmers to market processors. Under this partnership, USAID provided loan funds in the amount of $722,000 for farmers to purchase seedlings. MKF Partner contributed $150,000 and provided business premises, financial education, and technical assistance to participating farmers to improve the quality and quantity of their harvests. To date REGA provided below-market interest rate loans (6.99% annual, nominal rate) to 500 targeted producers, thus increasing employment and indirectly supporting 1,846 family members and increasing household incomes of participating rural farmers by 33%. In the reporting period, REGA II introduced new crops (i.e., American High Bush Blueberry) to 38 BiH farmers; assisted 500 farmers and five cooperatives in establishing sales agreements for sales of berries, cherries, and sour cherries; and disbursed additional loans to 38 farmers to purchase seedlings for the 2013 planting season.</Description>

<Description>USAID/BiH plans to enter into a GDA public private alliance with a Bosnian bank, UPI Banka, and a soft fruit processor, Bosnaplod.  The objective of the alliance is to expand soft fruit production and increase employment for small farmers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).  Although BiH has a comparative advantage in soft fruit production, it currently imports considerable amounts of raw material for processing and domestic use.  At the same time, BiH has a significant unemployment problem, and many small farms capable of producing soft fruits are currently under-employed. The GDA will offer an opportunity to develop sustainable livelihoods for farmers who have access to land and labor.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Russian Media Partnership to Combat HIV/AIDS</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The goal of the Russian Media Partnership to Combat HIV/AIDS is to mobilize the communication power of mass media and commercial marketing in the Russian Federation to: improve awareness among the general population and specific target groups (i.e. vulnerable populations, including youth) about HIV/AIDS and ways to prevent the spread of the disease; create a highly visible and mainstream platform to give public voice to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), thereby encouraging the general population to identify and build solidarity with and empathy for PLWHA and members of vulnerable groups; and support the creation of an environment that enables increased awareness, education, discussion and behavior modification that will ultimately slow the spread of HIV/AIDS.  Today the Partnership unites over 40 media companies across different segments of the media market--television, radio, print, outdoor cinema theaters, internet, entertainment media and consumer products--in an effort to use their core competency to fight HIV/AIDS.  The RMP creates an opportunity for constructive dialogue on HIV/AIDS on all levels, which leads to awareness and tolerance of PLWH and prevention of new cases of HIV.  The RMP model unites the resources and expertise of participating media companies, the investments and experience of international partners, the expertise and support of local stakeholders from the private sector, and state structures and civil society-- in particular, communities of people living with HIV.  The RMP implements a comprehensive awareness campaign which includes PSAs, integration of messaging into entertainment programming, access to informational resources on HIV, and trainings for journalists and editors on covering HIV.  In 2006 alone, RMP investment of free advertising space for campaign messages totaled 2,000 minutes on national television (with 11% in primetime); over 3000 billboards; and 24,000 PSAs shown before features in movie theaters.  Twelve training sessions for over 200 journalists and editors were provided.  According to the results of an All-Russia survey, conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation in June 2006, in the first 6 months of the year 62% of Russians (88 million) had encountered the campaign (video, outdoor, logo); of these, 11% (9.7 million) took concrete action to learn more about HIV as a result of the contact.  Those who saw at least one campaign PSA more frequently are convinced that an individual can take measures to prevent HIV transmission (91% vs. 84%), and much more frequently report taking measures to protect themselves (62% vs. 50%); they much more often report interest in learning more about HIV (44% vs. 31%) and much more frequently take concrete actions to get such information (22% vs. 9%).  The RMP is recognized as the major informational initiative on HIV in Russia today by the State.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Russian Professional Development in HIV/AIDS Medicine</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>&quot;This public-private partnership aims to train a cadre of health care professionals in state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS treatment and care so that they can serve as experts and leaders in the field.

This partnership brings the global pharmaceutical company Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GSK) together with the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to further the professional development of Russian medical specialists in regions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Under the project, a core group of clinical leaders will be trained through an intensive two-year fellowship program that will significantly enhance their clinical expertise in HIV medicine.

Participants in the fellowship program are selected based on their qualifications and potential to become future leading authorities in the HIV/AIDS field.  In particular, their ability and will to educate others—to provide peers with the knowledge and advice needed to build the overall capacity of the Russian HIV-related medical sector—is considered.  

The project will use an interactive Russian-language Web portal, developed under the EurasiaHealth project, to allow medical professionals to share best practices and to access a library of the latest resources, including treatment guidelines and protocols, textbooks, training materials, and clinical case studies.  

GlaxoSmithKline and the implementing partner, the American International Health Alliance (AIHA), selected 18 outstanding HIV professionals on a competitive basis to form the core group of experts.  

As of July 2008, two training workshops had been conducted and the web site had become operational.  In addition, AIHA piloted a six-week distance learning course during which 5 clinical case studies were actively discussed online by the selected professionals.

<Description>With ASMED’s technical support and ARFC loan, the Sadat Tomato Paste Company is planning to increase the daily production capacity. With new equipment and new place, the company is planning to create additional 25 direct jobs and 250 indirect (mostly farmers, tomato suppliers). The company anticipates that after the set-up of the new equipment, the initial production will be 30,000 bottles (each bottle 750 g weight of tomato paste) per day and 780,000 bottles of tomato paste on a monthly basis. ASMED supported the Sadat Tomato Paste Company (STPC) through a GDA ($120,000). The Sadat Tomato Paste Company now produces a higher quality tomato paste based on the recommendations of a local BDS. The new high-quality tomato paste is called Omul Belad and was introduced to the market in April. The company is able to produce 20,000 bottles each shift and is now able to compete with similar imported products. The warehouse has the capacity of storing 8,000 barrels of semi-processed tomato material. STPC also successfully implemented a strategic marketing plan advertising its new high quality tomato paste.</Description>

The downstream effects of this initiative will be to promote economic growth by preserving the lives of economically active people and the social fabric of its communities.  Improving the quality of the blood service will be a major contribution to improving the quality of the National Health Service .  The improved efficiency of operations will allow for the cost of blood to be kept at a level that will not cause a black market in unscreened blood, which would work to the detriment of the blood service.  The most significant contribution will be to significantly reduce the level of HIV and other infectious diseases.</Description>

ASMED supported the Light-Weight Concrete Production Facility through a GDA ($385,000) in Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province, to produce lightweight concrete building material. The material has several unique characteristics including its weight, being self-insulating, energy efficient and damp-free.  In addition, the use of LITEBUILT concrete speeds up construction time by 30-40 percent, and there is no need to grout between blocks.  With a price comparable to traditional brick, LITEBUILT also reduces energy and labor costs, making it an environmentally friendly and cost-effective building material.</Description>

<Description>The SIMM Project builds upon USAID&apos;s current interventions in microenterprise access and mobile banking to expand financial services through technologies.  SIMM advances three inter-connected goals: 1) boost expansion and rapid adoption of m-money services; 2) create an enabling environment for m-money; and 3) increase financial inclusion for broad-based economic growth.


To reach these goals, SIMM targets three broad areas of strategic intervention: (i) the payment system, (ii) government services, and (iii) electronic payroll distribution.  Cutting across these strategic areas, the activities of SIMM will also address both (a) supply and (b) demand constraints to broader adoption of m-money in the Philippines and © promote global knowledge sharing.  USAID has worked extensively with the two main mobile network operators (MNOs) Globe and Smart over the past few years and is expanding its cooperation to deepen financial inclusion through technological innovations grounded in development applications.</Description>

<Description>The Sesame Street Alliance (2004-2013), a USAID partnership with Sesame Workshop, combines USAID’s in-country education experts with Sesame Street Workshop’s creative legacy to co-produce local content adaptations of Sesame Street. Each series focuses on basic literacy and math skills, while encouraging girls’ education, positive health and hygiene practices, mutual respect and understanding among individuals and cultures, and other regionally relevant issues. Sesame Street teaches these concepts to parents as well as to children, helping to reinforce the learned behavior at home. In 2009, 90% of Egyptian children aged 2-8 watched the program, as well as 70% of female caregivers. The HIV-positive South African character Kami teaches over 6 million children how she copes with the loss of her mother. In Jordan, the alliance aired 26 half-hour episodes covering health, respect and understanding, and the environment, as well as eight public service announcements. Programming in India explores gender equality, environment, and diversity for 157 million children under the age of six. Total partner investment reached $7.5 million.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Solar Power for Rural Health Facilities</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>&quot;In collaboration with the University of Arizona, SolarAid is installing solar power units at rural hospital facilities. Electrification of these facilities allows staff to utilize laboratories and surgical theatres more fully and predictably and to store more drugs for longer periods of time. Additionally home-based care volunteers are able to provide better coordinated and responsive patient outreach because of reliable telecommunications. Also, the clinic and community members will be able to establish income-generating activities (IGAs) that rely on electricity.

SolarAid is currently operating only within Iringa Region. The funding here will be to support rural medical facilities in another region (e.g. Mbeya). SolarAid will design site specific solar system layout, procure recommended solar energy equipment and install to a minimum of 20 health facilities.

SolarAid will work with USAID to identify suitable health clinics that will commit to understanding and agreeing to the work needed to maintain the system, and to the processes necessary for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

<Description>The goal of the sorghum project is to improve the competitiveness of Nigerian sorghum producers, thereby increasing the income of small, medium, and large-scale farmers.  It is expected that the project will substantially increase the output of beneficiary farmers to over 50,000 metric tons per year, a 40 percent increase from current levels.  This will be accomplished through strengthening village-level producer associations and credit groups.  As a result of adopting demand-led, sustainable production technologies, project-assisted farmers will increase their sales of value-added sorghum, increasing their cash flow and net incomes.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Southern Africa Trade Hub</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Southern Africa Trade Hub is a USAID project aimed at increasing international competitiveness, intra-regional trade, and food security in the region. SATH promotes regional food security by addressing transportation and trade barriers along regional trade corridors, and by strengthening trade in key food commodities, including corn, soybean, and groundnuts. Microsoft Corporation has been a key partner to USAID on the ICT aspects of the Southern Africa Trade Hub initiative. Specifically, USAID and Microsoft have partnered (2010-2014) to develop the first customs systems interface and connectivity in Southern Africa through the Microsoft Corporation Cloud Computing Program as, prior to this partnership, customs systems were not connected across international borders. The partnership launched the Trans-Kalahari Corridor (TKC) eCustoms and eTrade Pilot-Project on Customs Systems Interface, Connectivity, Electronic Data Interchange and the Single Window Concept as the first step in a larger vision of regional integration, aiming to further extend cooperation to national banking and financial intelligence, to reduce bonds, and to provide in-depth shipment information so as to create greater predictability and superior risk-management capabilities. Objectives include allowing electronic data interchange of Customs and other documents and information, enabling electronic submission of supporting documents to Customs and relevant stakeholders, reducing transaction costs on traded goods, increasing efficiency in the Customs Service, creating a business environment, creating a Single Window (that connects government agencies, private sector traders, freight forwarders, transportation companies and other stakeholders), and providing a platform for automating the TKC Corridor Performance Monitoring System (CPMS). The project’s investment cap is $82.6 million.</Description>

Through financial and technical assistance, USAID helps farmers to establish cooperatives and improve the lives of their members; builds coffee washing stations; trains world class Rwandan cuppers (professional coffee tasters); and markets Rwanda&apos;s premium coffees in the global market. 
One of SPREAD&apos;s objectives is to map the coffees of Rwanda. Similar to the geography of wines in France, SPREAD will identify the regional taste characteristics of coffees. This will allow consumers and buyers to select coffees from specific areas of Rwanda and know what to expect.</Description>

A created shared network will enable municipal institutions to ensure that information on pension payments, healthcare, education, business services, and other social benefits is accessible in a way that encourages returnees to actually register their residence in Srebrenica and Bratunac.  It will also create the opportunity for the community of Srebrenica to communicate with people and institutions from other cities, developed rural areas, and education institutions worldwide.  Introduction to new communication technologies will open these communities to the world, enabling better communication and higher efficiency when communicating with potential peers and partners.</Description>

The SCI project harnesses the untapped potential of energy savings as a creative means of promoting community development, stimulating local self-reliance and local civil society strengthening.  The community planning methodologies introduced through the SCI project support meaningful citizen participation in decision making on issues directly affecting their lives and livelihoods at the local level.  The Institute for Sustainable Communities selected ten locations to participate in SCI program (RFE, Ural, Volga, Baikal regions).  These targeted communities were invited to submit their proposals, based on new partnerships and assessment of local needs.  Training and consultations for applicant communities were provided through the network of regional support centers.  The Coordinating Council of the SCI program reviewed all selected community proposals and approved them for funding in 2007.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>STCP - Sustainable Tree Crops</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The West Africa Sustainable Tree Crop Program (2003-2006), a USAID partnership with Mars Corporation, Cadbury, Hershey’s, KRAFT, Nestle, and World Cocoa Foundation, fostered sustainable cocoa farms in Cameroon, Côte d&apos;Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Nigeria. Implemented by International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the program sought to provide farmers with organizational support, marketing information, policy reform aid, and technical training in order to improve their economic and social well-being. At “farmer field schools,” farmers were taught how to boost their incomes by increasing yields and improving cocoa quality while protecting the surrounding environment. Specific training included instruction about disease and pest control, shade management, tree husbandry, and post-harvest handling. Total project investment reached $9,731,500, with USAID putting in $2,181,200 and partners contributing $6,550,300 in cash and $1 million in-kind. The success of this initial program led to the establishment of a follow-up Sustainable Tree Crop Program from 2007 to 2011, whose total investment reached $25 million.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Strengthening of Pediatric HIV/AIDS Services in Tanzania</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>USAID and the Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) partnership is focused to supporting the Government of Tanzania to address the critical issue of identifying and treating children who have been exposed to the HIV infection in the country.  These private-public partners seek to share their respective strengths, experience, technologies, methodologies, and resources (including human, in-kind, and monetary) in order to improve the identification of and services to children who suffer from HIV and AIDS.  The partnership also aims to reduce new HIV infections and HIV/AIDS-related morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents, and to strengthen the human resources available to provide health services for children in Tanzania. 

USAID, through the United States President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), will provide cash amounting to $22.5 million over the period of five years, and BIPAI’s contribution will be a similar amount made up of cash and in-kind.  BIPAI has also secured additional funding from several private donors, including Abbott Fund, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Jan and Dan Duncan, and the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word.  This partnership will support the operations of the two centers of excellence and associated satellite clinic facilities.  It is expected that the centers will provide care directly to at least 15,000 children.  Another 4,400 children will receive care in associated satellite facilities.</Description>

<Description>The purpose of the Strengthening Sustainable Ecotourism in and around Nyungwe National Park (SSENNP) project is to transform Nyungwe National Park (NNP) into a viable ecotourism destination, capable of generating employment and sustainable and equitable income for local communities and other stakeholders, thus providing economic incentives to conserve the rich biodiversity of the Park.  In spite of its attractions, the lack of alternative good quality, clean, medium-priced accommodation around the park is a major impediment to increasing tourism numbers and revenue in NNP. An analysis of the NNP tourism value chain identified the low volume  of tourists as the central challenge given that low tourist numbers do  not create enough market demand  to generate alternative economic opportunities for local communities or investment incentives for the private sector.  Given the lack of market incentives for private sector investment in visitor infrastructure in and around NNP, the project through its Public-Private Partnership Fund (PPPF), provides financial support to those investors interested in implementing ecotourism projects that are considered a priority to consolidate the potential of NNP.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Structuring Partnerships for an Innovative Communications Environment (SPICE)</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>In partnership with Ezecom, a Cambodian internet service provider, the United States supported the development of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, in which Cambodians either called a number, or received a phone call, to hear recorded information in Khmer.  For instance, in preparation for the July 2013 national elections, U.S. partners established a voter information IVR platform that received over 600 thousand calls, enabling over half a million citizens to become more informed voters.  In another instance, U.S. partners set up an IVR system to provide garment workers with information about their legal rights.  Since September 2013, 5,700 Cambodians have called in for information.

The United States also collaborated with Google to enable the latest version of Google&apos;s Android operating system to support Khmer script on mobile phones.  Within a country where few Cambodians speak and read English proficiently, this intervention is significantly increasing Cambodians’ access to information.

These partnerships developed specific technologically-based tools that increased access to information for Cambodians, and enhanced the ability of civil society to connect with citizens and address development challenges.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Support to Bulgarian Community Foundations</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>In 2006, USAID awarded an 18-month grant to the Trust for Civil Society in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE Trust) in the amount of $150,000. The objective of the grant is to strengthen community development by enhancing the growth of community foundations (CFs) in Bulgaria. Charles Mott Foundation leveraged this amount by providing an additional $240,000 to the Trust ($150,000 for grants to community foundations and $90,000 for administration costs) for the period July 2006-June 2009. The overall purpose of this three-party partnership is to enhance the growth of CFs in Bulgaria. Specifically, it builds on the successes and legacies of USAID’s Community Fund Program (2001-2006). The three sub-objectives are:  - Strengthen the grant making capacity and knowledge about effective grant making  - Stimulate the growth of the CF grant making funds  - Improve the recognition of the CFs as local grant makers  The CEE Trust program has primarily facilitated the growth of the CF grant making funds by providing a match to money raised locally. It has also increased the effectiveness of their grant making by imposing quality standards, which will gradually lead to strengthening of the image of the CFs as effective local grant makers.  The CEE Trust has a long-term commitment to civil society development in Bulgaria, until 2011.  It will continue raising funds to support the CFs after the USAID grant as this program builds the basis for a longer-term sustainability strategy of the CFs. Mott Foundation has committed to continue supporting the Bulgarian community foundations beyond the completion of the current 3-year program. The type of support will depend on the CFs’ strategic plans, and may include continued matching funding for re-granting purposes and/or challenge grants for endowment building.</Description>

<Description>The Sustainable Dairy Global Development Alliance (SD-GDA) increases the profitability of small- and medium-sized dairy farms, generates meaningful employment, increases livelihoods, and protects natural resources in Central Asia.  The project focuses on the use and adoption of rotational grazing for increasing productivity in a cost-effective manner, and establishes a working demonstration farm and facilitates the creation of local input supply markets for continued adoption of this system.  The project also conducts training and outreach programs on sustainable dairy production, based on rotational grazing and sound farm and financial management.  The introduction and adoption of rotational grazing, an innovative and appropriate technology for the region, is crucial for developing a competitive sector and sustainable milksheds in a region where a majority of dairy products are imported.  Alliance partners (Winrock International, Gallagher Animal Management Systems, Fisher-Thompson, Inc, Teen Challenge Kazakhstan, Taurus Services, Inc., and the University of Vermont) are in the business of providing expertise, products, and services to dairy producers in the U.S. and across the globe.  This project will establish a model of appropriate technology for small- and medium-sized dairy farmers on the outskirts of Almaty.  Efforts will be focused on farmers and agribusinesses in Kazakhstan, but will encourage participation from those in other Central Asian countries as well.</Description>

<Description>The overall purpose of the SLP-P Alliance is to support San Martin’s green economic development while protecting its natural capital, and valuing its ecosystem services under a framework of the rights based approach. The Alliance seeks to promote forest conservation, sustainable agriculture and ecosystem service markets- considering gender as well as local and indigenous peoples issues- as key elements of green economic development in the Alto Mayo basin of the San Martin region, a globally important region of the Peruvian Amazon.

The Alliance represents a unique opportunity to support the Government of San Martin´s efforts to reduce deforestation and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to contribute to long-term sustainable economic development in the region. At the core of this Alliance is the establishment of an innovative $7 million/ 3-year public – private facility. The Facility will invest in low emissions and REDD+ development activities and business models that result in improved livelihoods for local communities and increased resilience to climate change. To prove that win-win scenarios for growth, communities and the environment exist, the SLP-P will take a market-based approach grounded in science – engaging the private sector in a way that informs investments while ensuring the health of the region’s ecosystems. The work of the Alliance will be implemented within the framework of a Rights Based Approach (RBA) that devotes special attention to indigenous peoples and gender issues.</Description>

<Description>On October 20, 2011, a USAID press release announced a three-year partnership with Swiss Re t ohelp fight hunger, build resilience to climate change, and reduce the costs of natural disasters. The USAID–Swiss Re partnership will provide access to customized, market-based insurance for poor farmers. With better insurance, these farmers and their families will be more able to cope with the effects of droughts, floods and other severe weather events that may become increasingly common as the climate changes, according to USAID. When farmers have better instruments to manage their risk, they can more easily get loans to buy new technologies that increase their yields and productivity, and they will have greater incentive to make such investments, knowing that they are buffered from extreme weather events. The partnership builds on the two organizations&apos; previous collaborations under USAID&apos;s Index Insuance Innovation Initiative.</Description>

<Description>This activity will seek to accelerate the early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) leading to 15,000 fewer deaths from TB. To achieve this outcome, USAID will work with its partners, under a Global Development Alliance, to identify, fund, and nurture innovative solutions to address challenges in controlling the TB epidemic in India.  Primarily, the activity will seek to address the involvement of the private sector in TB control by improving case notification rates and increasing the numbers of health care providers detecting and treating TB through innovative technologies.  Under this Alliance, USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) will serve as founding resource partners, and IKP Knowledge Park will be the implementing partner. Additional resource partners from both the GOI and private sector may join the Alliance at a later stage.

The Alliance will seek innovative interventions through a crowd-sourcing approach in three identified areas: public-private engagement, diagnostics, and treatment adherence through information and communication technology (ICT). The activity will help identify innovations and processes that can accelerate early diagnosis and successful treatment of TB.

<Description>1. Improve sustainable management of coastal economic resources in El Salvador.  2. Improve incomes of coastal community residents in El Salvador.  3. Improve environmental awareness among coastal community residents in El Salvador.  4. Improve sea turtle conservation in El Salvador. Coastal marine resources make an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy and are an important source of income for coastal residents. Because these resources are not well or sustainably managed, their contributions to the Salvadoran economy are at risk with impacts that fall heavily on the economically vulnerable coastal communities.     Since 2006, USAID/IMCCW has worked to improve Salvadoran natural resource management. In FY 2010 sea turtle conservation is one focus drawing attention to the broader need to improve coastal natural resource management and establish sustainable levels and methods of economic exploitation.    The state of sea turtles reflects the general state of Salvadoran coastal resources. Habitat degradation and unregulated, unsustainable collecting of the eggs of the four species of sea turtles nesting in El Salvador have brought a once abundant resource close to extinction with consequences that have affected thousands of families.    In February 2009 the Government of El Salvador banned any form of sea turtle commercialization. The economic impact would have fallen mostly on vulnerable tortugueros and their families. USAID/IMCCW and other organizations established a program that paid tortugueros to bring sea turtle eggs to beach hatcheries for protected incubation and release. This program succeeded in replacing lost tortugueros income, and released over 1 million sea turtle hatchlings. The program continues in 2011 as part of a long-term, national program of sea turtle conservation.    The Termoencogibles Partnership will establish an alliance to support sea turtle hatchery operations in the Costa del Sol in eastern El Salvador. The Costa del Sol is a particularly important foraging and nesting area for hawksbill sea turtles. The partnership use seed funding from USAID/IMCCW to bring together Termoencogibles and the Costa del Sol tortuguero group to continue sea turtle egg collection activities and hatchery operations for at least five years.</Description>

This effort also seeks to mobilize and equip senior volunteer members from U.S., international, and national professional associations to strengthen the skills of health workers and champion maternal, newborn, and child health programs in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the alliance will nurture emerging leaders in global health by creating Global Health Fellows, a new kind of internship opportunity for newly graduated clinicians. Fellows will have an opportunity to learn in-country, alongside leading experts from U.S. and in-country professional associations, to nurture a passion for global health, and go on to become teachers themselves, building the skills of future clinicians.

Partners collaborated on the design of the alliance, which provided 31 youth with intensive training in front office management, housekeeping, and food and beverage services. Participating hotels provided paid, on-the-job internships to help interns build their skills. Upon completion of the program, 85% of interns received employment offers from alliance partners. By 2009, an additional 68 interns – more than half of which were women – had been placed in internships. USAID’s partners contributed technical assistance and training.</Description>

<Description>The Youth Centers project, also known as Jangos Juvenis, was initiated to help curb the spread of HIV/AIDS.  The primary purpose of the Centers is to promote behavior change that will help young people avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.  Trained counselors are available to youth to discuss issues around HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  The counselors also help young people understand the importance of sexual delay, provide training in negotiation and refusal skills, and assist young people in setting behavior goals.  The Youth Centers also support outreach activities to build HIV/AIDS awareness in the communities that border the Centers.
In order to attract youth to the Centers, as well as to help Angola’s youth better prepare themselves for productive futures, a number of non-HIV/AIDS activities are sponsored at the Centers, including: skills training, sports events and cultural activities.   Each of the Youth Centers has all, or some combination of, the following: a general meeting room with audio-visual equipment, classrooms, a library, a counseling room, a computer lab, and a basketball court.  
The existing five Youth Centers are located in Cabinda, Cunene, Huambo, Huíla and Luanda provinces, and each is operated in partnership with a national non-governmental organization.</Description>

<Description>The objective of this alliance is to assist the development of the tourism industry in Georgia.  The outcomes have been different in various regions.  In the case of Svaneti and Racha, none of the participants succeeded in securing subsidized tourism loans administered by Procredit Bank, due to a highly cautious approach of the bank in these regions.  However, as the grantee reports, there is evidence that the trainings have had an impact on participants’ businesses.  One of the achievements of the projects is that the participants from the villages Mazeri, Iprali, Adishi, and Usghuli improved the sanitation systems of their houses.  Other participants used the knowledge received through the trainings in setting prices for their products and services.  In Samtskhe-Javakheti, five of the project participants received loans from Procredit Bank.  Four more entrepreneurs accessed grant support from USAID-funded Georgia Employment and Infrastructure Initiative (GEII) and the Small and Medium Enterprise Support Project.  One more interesting development under the project was the fact that Elkana Association, which was conducting trainings in Samtskhe-Javakheti, organized a special tour to familiarize Tbilisi tour operators with the guesthouses, which went through the training.  Possible next steps include the facilitation and the establishment of partnerships between these organizations.  (Implemented by Eurasia Foundation Small Grants and South Caucasus Cooperation Program.)</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Transparency and Governance in the Russian Securities Market</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This public-private partnership aims to support a more transparent framework for the Russian securities market in order to reduce market abuse and combat financial crime.  Its funding partners include: AK BARS Bank; Aton; Deutsche Bank; Deutsche Securities; East Kommerts; Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA); Goldman-Sachs; National Association of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR); OLMA Investment Firm; REGION Group; Renaissance Capital; Troika Dialog; UBS; and UniCredit.  Its implementing partners include: the National Association of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR); and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  This partnership brings together the Russian National Association of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR) and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) with 12 leading Western and Russian securities firms in an alliance to develop a new legal and regulatory framework for the brokerage industry in Russia.  The resulting NAUFOR CODE will offer a comprehensive set of rules and standards for professional activities in the securities market that will help increase transparency, diminish market abuse, and deter money laundering.  Due to significant evolutions in Russia’s securities market during recent years, existing regulations are no longer able to ensure proper transparency or prevent abuse of the new instruments, especially those available to individuals.  The NAUFOR Code will: introduce higher professional standards and ethics for securities markets participants in Russia; implement uniform and internationally recognized standards for securities transactions; adopt more efficient and effective measures for the regulation of brokers and other securities markets participants; and merge regulation of the Russian financial industry into the international financial system.  The NAUFOR Code will create safer and more transparent opportunities for Russians to participate in the securities market, diversify their financial risks, and engage in the expanding financial life of the country.  The project will also help build long-term professional partnerships between Russian and U.S. brokerage associations and contribute to a better investment climate in Russia for both domestic and foreign investors.  With support from the twelve private company partners, NAUFOR developed the Code’s draft texts in late 2007.  USAID then sponsored the contributions of FINRA’s experts to ensure the inclusion of global best practices in the Code.  In spring 2008, FINRA provided detailed comments and recommendations on five major sections of the Code, which were reflected in the final text.  The final draft of the Code is now being submitted to the securities market regulator, the Federal Financial Markets Service (FFMS), for consideration and adoption as a governing mechanism for securities market activities.  This initiative also laid the groundwork for future joint partnership projects between NAUFOR, its private sector partners, and USAID.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Ukrainian External Testing Initiative Legacy Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The Ukrainian Standardized External Testing Initiative Legacy Alliance (2010-2012), was a USAID partnership with American Councils for International Education, American Councils, National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, Union Rectors of Ukraine, Ministry of Education, Ukrainian Center for Education Quality Assessment, four Ukrainian universities, numerous NGOs, firms, as well as parents and educators. The alliance supported the use of an examination system to eliminate corruption in the admissions process of institutions of higher education, while strengthening civil society’s oversight of admission testing. It also facilitated the creation of new channels for expressing individual and group views by establishing the Education Law Policy Expert Group (ELPEG), a deliberative forum for all education reform stakeholders; creating the first NGO coalition to carry out independent outside monitoring of tests and university admissions; and implementing a sustained, broad-based public information and outreach campaign about independent external testing and its contribution to equitable university admissions. In 2009, the alliance established the Konkurs (“Contest”) system, which increased transparency by helping university applicants track admissions at universities of interest. The system included information on the number of total enrollment slots available by major, how many of them were state-funded, the subject tests required for application to a particular institution by major, annual tuition by major, study programs available (day or night classes), and a list of applicants by major. Institutions are now required to submit daily data updates on the applications accepted for review.</Description>

<Description>The partnership began with USAID’s plans to construct 156 new homes in Haut Damier for earthquake-affected families.  To bind these vulnerable households to the existing social fabric, UMCOR Haiti designed cross-community water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), livelihoods, and education services that will increase the ties between USAID’s beneficiary households and the existing residents, and improve living standards for all.

Under PISANS, the WASH component includes improved access to water through household rainwater-catchment systems, a hygiene-promotion campaign that utilizes local health promoters, and the distribution of hygiene kits and water-storage buckets. The education component includes improvements to four existing schools through a combination of repairs; the provision of new classrooms, kitchens, and water and sanitation facilities; and teacher training.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>USAID-American Chamber of Commerce: Investing in Education for Competitiveness</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The main purpose of the Grant is to increase corporate involvement in Dominican public schools to improve the quality of basic education, and to facilitate and encourage private sector participation in the national dialogue on education reform.  The American Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic (AMCHAM) has been implementing a program to promote private sector investment in education since January 2006.  The program provides technical and financial assistance to the private sector in their individual efforts to support Dominican public primary education.  Over the past eight months of the ongoing Grant, private sector interest in the program has increased as an effect of the results achieved.  AMCHAM is one of the country&apos;s leading business organizations comprised of close to 

2,700 member companies, of which 120 are U.S. companies established in the Dominican Republic.  The Chamber has recognized the vital importance of basic education to improving the competitive position of the Dominican Republic, and at the same time understands the responsibility of the private sector towards achieving that end.  In pursuing the purpose of increasing corporate involvement in Dominican public schools to improve the quality of basic education, and to facilitate and encourage private sector participation in the national dialogue on educational reform, AMCHAM submitted an Unsolicited Proposal to USAID/DR in 2006 which was accepted; thus, initiating a USAID/DR and AMCHAM Dominican Republic partnership.  As a direct result of this program 33 companies to date have become active Program participants; 31 schools have been integrated, with 111 quality-of-education interventions; and 16,343 Dominican children and 335 teachers have benefited from the interventions.</Description>

<Description>To contribute to the achievement of the Philippines&apos; Millennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation.  USAID will seek to: i) protect human and environmental health by improving access to clean water and hygiene practices; ii) reduce water pollution through improved sanitation systems and practices; and iii) promote locally sustainable development approaches. In the World Water Forum held in Istanbul,  RI and USAID launched the first concrete expression of their cooperation, dubbed as the &quot;Water Alliance&quot; aimed at helping countries achieve their Millennium Development Goals for water supply and basic sanitation.  The Philippines, along with Ghana and Dominican Republic, was selected as a pilot country in Asia for this cooperation.  The partnership unites the strengths of USAID, Rotary International, and Rotary Clubs located throughout the Philippines.  USAID, through its portfolio of water and sanitation projects--Philippine Sanitation Alliance (PSA), Philippine Water Revolving Fund (PWRF) and Alliance for Off-Grid Renewable Energy (AMORE), brings technical expertise, technologies, oversight capability, and funding.  Rotary International brings funding and oversight capability; and Rotary Clubs bring local engagement and commitment, oversight capability, and both in-kind and financial resources.  To date, USAID and the Rotary Foundation provided a total of US$1.1 million grant funding for five projects that will benefit 9,500 people with piped water supply and 168,000 people with improved wastewater treatment services.  These five projects are being implemented by PSA, PWRF and AMORE along with the Rotary Clubs of Zamboanga City West, Davao City, Dipolog City, San Fernando, La Union; and combined Districts 3810 and 3780.</Description>

<Description>The goal of the US-China Sustainable Buildings Partnership (SBP) is to promote sustained reductions in energy use in selected Chinese cities.  Working through public-private partnerships, the program brings together the experience and resources of the US and Chinese private sector and government policymakers to scale up green building policies and practices. Buildings account for more than 40% of global energy use and one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.  USAID, the implementing and GDA partners share the common goal of reducing energy use in China’s building sector.   To achieve this goal, the SBP is implemented through three integrated components that: (1) reduce energy use in existing buildings; (2) promote green building design and certification for new buildings; and (3) promote US-China policy cooperation.    The implementing partners are ICF International, China Academy of Building Research, Tongji University, and Questions &amp; Solutions Engineering, Inc.  Global Development Alliance (GDA) partners include the Energy Foundation, U.S. Green Building Council, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-rural Development, US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, and others.  The Energy Foundation provides cash GDA contributions, while most of the other GDA contributions are in-kind in program support.</Description>

ASMED’s support assists VetServ to establish itself as a private, for-profit entity and to increase outreach and reliability. VetServ has finished creating a strong new branding design for products it distributes to help increase sales. Currently, DCA activities are supported and subsidized by the USAID-funded ASAP program. As ASAP will be coming to an end, DCA has formed VetServ to sustainably continue its vaccine and medicine distribution services. This will make it independent of donor and NGO support and ensure that VFUs will continue to reliably obtain quality vaccines and medicines at competitive prices through the private sector, long after the ASAP project ends.</Description>

<Description>The Vietnam WiMAX Alliance (2006-2007), a USAID partnership with Intel Corporation and the Vietnam Data Communication Company, aimed to bring WiMAX (broadband networking) technology to an area with limited telecommunications in mountainous, rural northern Vietnam. The alliance, which came about as part of USAID’s Last Mile Initiative, installed WiMAX technology throughout Lao Cai township, enabling residents’ access to cost-efficient broadband internet and VoIP telephone services, while improving the business environment, educational opportunities, and the availability of medical services. In just six months, the alliance brought Internet connectivity to a town with a population of 30,000 and a province of 500,000 people. Intel provided overall project facilitation and technical leadership, funding support for WiMAX equipment procurement and installation, as well as WiMAX training. Intel also designed the complete wireless network and developed documentation of lessons learned and best practices for wider scalability. USAID provided project coordination, monitoring, facilitation and evaluation, resources for end-user hardware and software, support resources for network integration, technical and organizational support for user applications, and services and business/service models. Vietnam Data Communications arranged for the trial license and spectrum allocation, supplied transceiver station sites and backbone connectivity, operated and maintained the WiMAX network, provided end-to-end broadband telephony, and analyzed network services-related data. The success of the partnership’s work in Lao Cai led to the expansion to nearby Ta Van in early 2007. This second phase of the partnership was implemented by IPSTAR. The Ta Van project, from conception to deployment, took only six months, and reinforced the adaptability and scalability of the partnership’s solution.</Description>

<Description>The Vocational Training Alliance (2005-2012), a USAID partnership with Chevron Corporation, supported long-term economic development in Indonesia’s Aceh province, which had been affected both by the 2004 tsunami and armed conflict, by developing a local polytechnic institute. The partnership offered scholarships to more than 300 Acehnese youth aged 16-27 to attend at three-month vocational skill-building training at Chevron Polytechnic in Riau province from 2006-2007. The training was conducted in four phases. In the first two phases, the respondents were selected from the city of Banda Aceh, and from Aceh Besar, Pidie, and Ache Jeumpa districts. In the latter two, participants were chosen from Aceh Jaya, Aceh Barat, and Aceh Besar districts. In 2007, the partnership signed an agreement to develop Aceh Polytechnic. The institution provides vocational training in applied technology fields such as information technology, electronics, telecommunications, and business accountancy, which are critical to the continued reconstruction and development of this Indonesian province. The Government of Aceh selected the site for Aceh Polytechnic and purchased the land, while Chevron led the construction of the physical building, which was completed in August 2008 through a contract with CHF International. USAID funded the establishment of the academic and business operations through implementer Swisscontact.  In September 2008, the first class of 240 students began their studies; in 2009 total enrollment increased to 410 students and to 600 in 2010.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Volga River AIDS Alliance</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>This public-private partnership aims to scale up primary level care and treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS in the Samara and Saratov regions of Russia.  Its funding partner is the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), and the implementing partner is the American International Health Alliance (AIHA).  The core objectives of this partnership are to strengthen HIV/AIDS services at the primary care level in the Samara and Saratov Oblasts and to support regional goals to provide anti-retroviral treatment for 1,500 HIV-positive.  The Volga River AIDS Alliance provides clinical training and mentoring for primary level infectious disease specialists, HIV/AIDS care teams, and general practitioners in Togliatti (Samara Oblast), Balakovo, Engels, and Volsk (Saratov Oblast).  Togliatti has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Russia, and 12,000 city residents are registered as HIV-positive.  Under the partnership, the American International Health Alliance (AIHA) leads the training, monitoring and evaluation components, while the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) provides expertise in clinic operations and management, as well as professional mentors and faculty.  This project builds upon previous USAID-funded partnerships between Saratov-Bemidji with Minnesota and Togliatti with Providence, Rhode Island that created successful models of HIV/AIDS care, treatment, and support programs.  From 2006-2008, the partners initiated anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for over 1,500 patients, strengthened HIV/AIDS services at the primary care level by training infectious diseases specialists, primary care physicians, and nurses, and improved local access to services for HIV-positive patients.  At the closing conference, the partners highlighted the successful impact of the project and the municipal authorities outlined their plans for continued support for the initiative.  During the project, about 40 infectious disease specialists, 30 primary care physicians, and 20 nurses were trained.  The clinicians underwent rigorous and comprehensive training that prepared them to accurately assess the condition of HIV-infected patients, initiate and manage antiretroviral therapy, and diagnose and manage opportunistic infections that commonly afflict people living with HIV or AIDS.  AIHA and AHF also worked with regional health authorities to build institutional training capacity within the Volga region to ensure the sustainability of capacity building efforts beyond the project period.  The partners conducted “HIV 101” courses to give primary care practitioners accurate information about the disease and the spread of the epidemic in their region.  By strengthening communication and counseling skills, the courses helped combat stigma and discrimination, and provided the broader healthcare workforce with the knowledge and skills needed to help combat HIV/AIDS.  As a result, nearly 400 patients were referred to ART services by primary care clinicians that received training under the project.  Training sessions on case management also helped strengthen the regions’ referral system and increased patient satisfaction with services.  A total of 1650 patients are now on ART in both project sites.  In Togliatti, a joint committee on Tuberculosis and HIV also was created.  On September 12, the final conference of a two-year public private partnership between the American International Health Alliance (AIHA) and the San Francisco-based AIDS HealthCare Foundation (AHF) was held in Togliatti.  Located in Samara Oblast, Togliatti has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Russia and 12,000 city residents are registered as HIV-positive.  The AIHA-AHF partnership was launched in 2006 with support from USAID, through a Global Development Alliance initiative.  The project built upon the accomplishments of AIHA’s USAID-funded program linking health professionals in Togliatti and Saratov with American experts in Rhode Island and Minnesota (respectively) to create mode</Description>

<Description>The Water and Development Alliance (WADA), a partnership between USAID and The Coca-Cola Company, is supporting activities to improve the health, well-being, and self-sufficiency of community members – particularly those people living with HIV/AIDS – in villages and schools in Africa, starting in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal. Widespread poverty and illiteracy, insufficient supply of clean water and sanitation, and poor hygiene practices contribute to the elevated incidence of waterborne diseases, which greatly impacts the health and quality of life of children, the elderly, people living with HIV/AIDS, and their caregivers. To address this problem, WADA is working with the Mvula Trust, Re-Solve, Family Health International, Msunduzi Hospice ,and Eskom (the local electrical utility) in Ramotshinyadi village in Limpopo and seven schools in KZN to increase access to water and sanitation services and improve household hygiene practices.  The project also trains community health care workers, teachers and learners on basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) skills and the importance of WASH for people living with HIV/AIDS.</Description>

<Description>In Angola, the Water and Development Alliance (WADA) provides new water supply to poor urban residents, while reenergizing participatory governance in Kilamba Kiaxi and Viana, peri-urban municipalities near the capital city of Luanda.  The project will construct nine public water tap stands and provide access to potable water for 23,000 people.  A model of community management of tap stands will be implemented, with oversight by the water utility and the local administration.  Beyond infrastructure and service improvements, the project contributes significantly to reestablishing a functioning civil society by engaging local government, citizens, and private sector stakeholders to collaboratively govern water service delivery, and catalyze further public investment in potable water and sanitation.  With this project, WADA is supporting Angola’s transition toward national reconciliation and peace that began in earnest in 2002.  WADA is helping Angola strengthen local democratic governance and increase access to essential social services.  Through this activity to provide cooperatively managed water supply systems to the urban poor, USAID, SAB Miller (local Coca-Cola bottler) and their local partner CARE International are also bringing together collaborators and resources from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm, and synergies from the Angola Electricity Support Program—indirectly creating a consortium of private and public sector organizations active in regional economic development.</Description>

By promoting the growth and development of a reliable agriculture inputs system and improving the agricultural enabling policy environment for seed trade, the partnership contributed to the overall growth of the West African agricultural sector. Implemented by International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics and Citizen’s Network for Foreign Affairs, the alliance focused on building the capacity of seed companies and established a network of over 800 agro dealers in each of the five countries, reaching more than 500,000 farmers. Through this alliance, more than 900 small agro dealers were identified and trained in product knowledge and basic business management. The project established agro dealer demonstration plots and facilitated agro dealer field days, with more than 1,000 participants.</Description>

Implemented by International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the program sought to provide farmers with organizational support, marketing information, policy reform aid, and technical training in order to improve their economic and social well-being. At “farmer field schools,” farmers were taught how to boost their incomes by increasing yields and improving cocoa quality while protecting the surrounding environment. Specific training included instruction about disease and pest control, shade management, tree husbandry, and post-harvest handling. Total project investment reached $9,731,500, with USAID putting in $2,181,200 and partners contributing $6,550,300 in cash and $1 million in-kind. The success of this initial program led to the establishment of a follow-up Sustainable Tree Crop Program from 2007 to 2011, whose total investment reached $25 million.</Description>

<Description>New partnership to develop and implement a program that will focus on capacity building of health care practitioners. It will begin with development of a National ART curriculum and the training of Master Trainers.  Program expansion in future years will include development of training curricula on other aspects of HIV and other health conditions/topics.  Universities will review and adopt curricula, thereby adopted as &quot;WAIDI approved&quot; for use by Master Trainers. This PPP will establish the West African Infectious Diseases Institute (WAIDI), a center of excellence for prevention, care, and treatment of infectious diseases. WAIDI will build the capacity of healthcare professionals from Nigeria and the region through a training program adapted by USG and GON and implemented by team of master trainers who specialize in clinical infectious disease management and laboratory sciences. The feasibility of a WAIDI facility to provide a venue for clinical teaching and research, modeled after the Infectious Disease Institute of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, has been explored. ACCORDIA Foundation, an organization instrumental in the development of the Ugandan IDI conducted an advocacy visit and fact finding mission to Nigeria in COP08. In COP09, the USG WAIDI team will further develop its collaborations with ACCORDIA in the planning and development of WAIDI, including the exploration of private sector interests such as Exxon Mobil.</Description>

<Description>The Wok Alliance (2008-2010), a USAID partnership with the Wok restaurant chain and ACCION SOCIAL, identified key market linkages and strengthened the supply chain of small agricultural producer associations in Colombia’s capital, Bogotá. The Wok restaurant chain serves Asian dishes in several locations around Bogotá, and is committed to sourcing locally as many ingredients as possible, including fish, langostinos, shrimp, coconut milk, vegetables, and spices. The alliance worked with farmers’ associations, fishermen, and rural cooperatives to provide training and technical assistance, enabling local small producers to pursue licit livelihoods. Ultimately, the program contributed to higher productive potential for eight small producer groups and increased incomes for 675 rural farmers and fishermen. These local producers, primarily indigenous Afro-Colombians, live in regions disproportionately affected by the Colombian conflict.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Youth Business Leadership Project</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>There are not many opportunities for youth in Azerbaijan. It is difficult for young people to find jobs or start their own businesses right after they finish education at universities. The majority of leadership positions in economic spheres are dominated by the older generation. Potential employers require prior job experience and certain level of business skills. To improve student business and professional skills and expose them to professional role models that can provide them with career and development guidance, USAID is partnering with British Petroleum (BP) and American Chamber of Commerce. All project participants maintain a strategy that focuses heavily on the professional development of youth. The Youth Business Leadership project provides internships at high profile companies to third and fourth year university students, conducts professional development workshops; and provides internship and mentorship opportunities with successful businessmen and businesswomen. This partnership incorporates the respective contributions of the participants. BP provides funding support equal to USAID’s share, gives general recommendations and provides oversight to the Project’s progress particularly in the process of selecting interns and internship positions and matching interns with mentors, and ensuring that the project meets its objectives. The American Chamber of Commerce provides support in identifying internship opportunities and mentors and in placing three months long internships at high profile companies. The implementer of the project, Junior Achievement Azerbaijan (JAA), has already provided workshops and internships to 75 students from four universities in Baku out of life of the project target of 120 students.</Description>

Malaria prevalence in Zambia has tripled over the past three decades. In a population of 10.2 million, there are up to 4 million clinical cases of malaria, accounting for 40 percent of outpatient visits and admissions to health care facilities, and as many as 50,000 deaths per year. People living with HIV/AIDS are extremely vulnerable to malaria, and face an increased likelihood of death and debilitating illness. In 2005, an estimated 1.1 million adults and children were living with HIV in Zambia. An estimated 98,000 adults and children died from AIDS, leaving behind a growing number of AIDS orphans, currently estimated at 710,000. Objectives: To distribute more than 500,000 long-lasting insecticide-treated nets to some of the most vulnerable households in Zambia, providing protection against malaria for approximately 1 million Zambians.    The partnership will build on an existing HIV/AIDS platform, RAPIDS (Reaching HIV-Affected People with Integrated Development and Support), a consortium of six organizations that provides an integrated package of community-based prevention, treatment and care support to orphans and vulnerable children and people living with HIV/AIDS in all nine provinces of Zambia. Consortium members include World Vision, Africare, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, the Salvation Army Zambia, and the Expanded Church Response. RAPIDS reaches more than 154,000 Zambian households through its network of 12,000 volunteer Zambian caregivers.</Description>

<Partnership_x0020_Name>Zia  UDDIN Wool Washing</Partnership_x0020_Name>
<Description>The company will be formed to take advantage of the absence of and industrial scale wool washing facility in Afghanistan, and to compete against companies in the neighboring country of Pakistan. The viability of the company has been long researched and the concluded belief is that “Uddin Wool Washing” is very viable, if undertaken with accurate planning and implementation.  The launch and growth strategy of “Uddin Wool Washing” will be of market entrance and then capitalizing on the increased transportation, and turn around time in Pakistan due to on-going insecurity.  Presently, the Pakistani service providers do not offer a satisfactory, safe and easily accessible solution that yields the service users (wool traders and spinners, and carpet producers) any great value. The local users must plan significant amount of time, risks and efforts to get their product to Pakistan for wash.  In short, “Uddin Wool Washing” plans to target the underserved wool and carpet subsectors in Afghanistan, seek out niches and unmet demand for wool washing service, and offer a higher level of service to the local wool traders and spinners, and carpet producers, and a higher standard of product for them.</Description>
